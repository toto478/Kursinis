AES ANDES THIRD QUARTER OF 2023 RESULTS
AES Andes S.A. (hereinafter referred to as AES Andes, or the Company) recorded EBITDA of US$259 million in the
third quarter of 2023, up 37% from the US$189 million achieved in the same period of 2022 primarily due to higher
gross profit in Colombia and Chile, partly offset by lower gross profit in Argentina.
• EBITDA in the Chilean market reached US$105 million, a 3% decrease from the third quarter of 2022. The
main driver was lower regulated sales volumes in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same quarter of
2022, in addition to lower contract prices, partly offset by an increase in unregulated sales volumes and lower
energy purchases costs in the spot market.
• EBITDA in Colombia reached US$144 million in the third quarter of 2023, a US$77 million increase compared
to the same period of 2022. The main driver for this increase is higher sales volumes to the spot market at
higher prices, in addition to the impact of the appreciation of the Colombian peso, partly offset by lower margin
from contracted sales in 2023 as a consequence of higher energy purchases prices to supply contracted
demand.
• EBITDA in Argentina reached US$10 million during the third quarter of 2023, representing a US$4 million
decrease compared to the same quarter in 2022. The main drivers were lower Energía Plus contract prices,
lower Energía Base sales due to lower dispatch at Termoandes and higher other costs of sales.
Net Income Attributable to Parent (“Net Income”) reached US$65 million in the third quarter of 2023, which positively
compares to the Net Income of US$63 million in the third quarter of 2022. The main drivers for this increase relates to
the growth in EBITDA and the elimination of the Result by readjustment units as a result of the change in the functional
currency in Argentina from Argentine pesos to US dollars in July 2023. These positive variations were partly offset by a
negative effect in foreign currency exchange differences and higher income taxes.

2023 HIGHLIGHTS AND RECENT EVENTS
Greentegra Strategy Execution
AES Andes continues to expand its portfolio, incorporating renewable energy and energy storage, leveraging on its
long-term relationship with customers in the markets in which it operates.
Innovative Solutions
Since the launch of its Greentegra Strategy, the Company has executed renewable Power Purchase Agreements
(PPAs) totaling more than 14.6 TWh/y in Chile and Colombia, providing its customers with innovative and competitive
solutions to satisfy their energy needs, contributing to their sustainability goals.
AES Andes offers flexibility to its customers through various energy solutions supporting their transition to a
sustainable supply.
a. New renewable energy PPAs
Codelco (Chile):
AES Andes and Codelco signed an agreement that will replace the current supply based on coal delivered to the
mining company with renewable energy. This milestone is a new step for AES Andes in the materialization of its
Greentegra transformational strategy and an important advance in the sustainability processes of one of the world's
leading mining companies. The agreement contemplates supplying the electricity demand of Radomiro Tomic and
Ministro Hales, Codelco's operations in the Antofagasta Region. These two mines currently produce around a third of
the state-owned company's annual copper production, which thanks to this agreement will be produced with 100%
emission-free electricity.
Under the agreement, AES Andes will supply up to 1.6 TWh/year of renewable energy between 2026 and 2040.
Microsoft (Chile):
AES Andes S.A. entered into an Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Microsoft Chile to supply renewable energy to
the technology company in Chile for 15 years. The 300 GWh/y PPA will allow Microsoft to reduce its carbon footprint in
line with its proposed goals so that by 2025, 100% of its data centers' energy supply will be based on renewable
generation and by 2030 be carbon negative.
Teck - Quebrada Blanca (Chile):
AES Andes entered into a clean energy supply contract with Teck Resources' Chilean subsidiary for a 17-year term
beginning in January 2025 for the Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 copper project in the northern Tarapacá Region.
AES Andes will provide 1,069 GWh/y from renewable sources, including wind, solar, hydroelectric and battery storage
systems so that the mining company can have a decarbonized supply as of 2025.

years starting in January 2024, requires 94 MW of renewable generation and 17 MW of batteries with a 5-hour storage
capacity.
b. Green Hydrogen:
Chile has natural, economic and infrastructure conditions, that place it in an excellent position to become a world
leader in the production and export of green hydrogen (GH2), an emission-free fuel that will play a fundamental role in
the implementation of the nation's net zero carbon emission plan.
In this context, AES Andes signed a memorandum of understanding with a major international hydrogen producer to
conduct a feasibility study to execute a large green hydrogen-based ammonia production project in the country. This
document was signed in February 2021 and the project in question has the potential to require more than 800 MW of
new renewable energy supply. In parallel, AES is working on the measurement of baselines and technical and
environmental studies for the realization of this project, as well as reviewing the financial, legal and corporate structure
options to carry out this process.
Angamos Green Hydrogen Project (Adelaida)
In June 2022, AES Andes announced a green hydrogen initiative that constitutes its first project with this energy vector,
called "fuel of the future". Empresa Eléctrica Angamos, a subsidiary of AES Andes, seeks to promote the "Adelaida
project", which consists of the production, storage, refueling station and distribution of green hydrogen. This initiative
will be built on the grounds of the Angamos Thermoelectric Power Plant, located in Mejillones, in the Antofagasta
Region of Chile. Adelaida will produce GH2 by electrolysis with the desalinated water Angamos already produces and
renewable energy. Construction of the project is expected to begin in late 2023, and the plant is expected to start
operations in 2024.
Adelaida involves the construction and operation of a green hydrogen production plant (GH2) located adjacent to the
Angamos plant and will have a production capacity of 1,000 kg/day of green hydrogen, equivalent to 2.5 MW of power.
It also includes two GH2 refueling stations for vehicles that use hydrogen as fuel, especially for the mining, port and
other industries.
In practical terms, the project seeks to facilitate the conditions to scale up the use of hydrogen in the future through a
refueling station that will make sustainable mobility viable in the region and promote the change of fuels in the
transportation sector towards 100% renewable and emission-free solutions.
On October 26, 2022 AES Andes announced the launch of the first Green Hydrogen Open Season in Chile after
receiving environmental approval for Adelaida. The process seeks to activate the market and trigger a specific demand
from companies in the Antofagasta Region interested in using green hydrogen to make their operations more
sustainable. In May 2023, the open season process was completed, in which market information and important
learning for the industry and the project was obtained. During the second half of 2023, the best alternative will be
studied, based on the information obtained in the open season process, in order to move forward with the project.
c. Maverick
The AES Corporation chose AES Andes to test a new and innovative technology known as "Maverick", which will
revolutionize the way photovoltaic parks are built worldwide. The 10 MW pilot project was developed at the Andes
Solar II subsidiary, as part of the Andes Solar IIB project, which came into operation on July 17, 2023.
This technology was developed by the Australian company 5B and allows the construction of photovoltaic parks in
small spaces, significantly reducing installation time. This technology will provide the Company with a new competitive
advantage to offer renewable and competitive energy solutions to its customers.

b. Shut down of Laguna Verde plant
AES Andes took a new step in its process of accelerating the transition to renewable energy. In line with this effort, the
definite disconnection was approved by the National Energy Commission (CNE), on May 31, 2021, for the definitive
disconnection of the units - two steam turbines and one gas unit - that conform Laguna Verde Power Plant (58 MW),
located in the town of the same name in the region of Valparaíso.
c. Guacolda Sale agreement
On July 14, 2021, approval was obtained from the National Economic Prosecutor's Office and on July 20, 2021, the
process of transferring its 50.0000005% interest in the subsidiary Guacolda, owner of a 764 MW coal-fired power
plant, was completed for US$34 million to the new owner.
d. Decarbonization Agreement
On June 4, 2019, the Company and other power generation companies in the Chile reached voluntary agreements for
the disconnection and cease of operation of a series of coal-fired generation plants with the Government of Chile.
Subsequently, on December 26, 2020, Supreme Decree No. 42 was published, which, among other things, created a
new operating status "Strategic Reserve State" (ERE for its acronym in Spanish) that allows withdrawing certain plants
from the usual dispatch of energy, being essentially ready to resume their operation under conditions of extreme
scarcity in the system with a prior notice of 60 calendar days.
The Ventanas 1 power plant was authorized by the National Electric Coordinator to retire, disconnect and cease
operations as of June 30, 2022.
Meanwhile, the Ventanas 2 unit was authorized to enter ERE as long as it adjusts to the entry into service of the
second 220/110 kV - 300 MVA transformer of the Agua Santa substation. On August 24, 2023, AES Andes requested
the National Energy Commission (CNE) the exemption of the 24-month term to report the early and definitive
withdrawal, disconnection and cessation of operations from the National Electric System of the coal-fired generation
unit Ventanas 2, effective December 31, 2023. AES Andes also requested that the request to place this unit in the
Strategic Reserve Status be annulled, in view of the fact that to date the unit has not been declared in this status,
taking into consideration factors beyond AES Andes' control and related to the security of the electricity supply in the
Valparaíso Region. On October 12, 2023, the CNE by means of Exempt Resolution No. 482 authorized the
disconnection and definitive cessation of operations of the Ventanas 2 unit as from December 31, 2023.
On July 6, 2021, AES Andes signed with the Chilean Ministry of Energy an amendment to the Disconnection and
Cease of Operations Agreement signed on June 4, 2019. In light of this amendment, AES Andes has made available
Units 3 and 4 of Ventanas Complex and Angamos Units 1 and 2, with installed capacities of 267 MW, 272 MW, 277
MW and 281 MW, respectively and jointly a total of 1,097 MW, to cease its operations based on coal from January 1,
2025, as soon as the safety, sufficiency and competitiveness of the system allows.
On May 25, 2023, in accordance with the provisions of Article 72°-18 of the General Electric Services Law, AES Andes
informed the National Energy Commission, the Superintendence of Electricity and Fuels and the National Electric
Coordinator, the definitive disconnection from the National Electric System of the coal-fired generation units Norgener
1 and Norgener 2, as of December 31, 2025. These units make up the Norgener Thermoelectric Power Plant with an
installed capacity of 276 MW located in the commune of Tocopilla, Antofagasta Region, Chile. As a result of the
aforementioned events, AES Andes recorded an impairment loss on Property, Plant and Equipment affecting net
income of US$ 198 million in the second quarter of 2023.
The Company continues to work with the authorities and its customers to establish the future steps in its
decarbonization schedule with a view to achieving the strategic emission reduction objectives and the official targets of
the energy roadmap.

e. Alba Project ( Molten Salts)
On October 17, 2022, AES Andes submitted for environmental processing a worldwide pioneer initiative that seeks an
alternative for the conversion of thermoelectric power plants through the use of molten salts.
This "Alba" project explores the possibility of replacing the current coal-fired generation of units 1 and 2 of the
Angamos Thermoelectric Power Plant, located in Mejillones, Antofagasta Region, with a molten solar salt system. With
this technology, renewable energy is stored as heat to be later used to provide energy and emission-free capacity to
the electrical system.
The project aims to use solar salts, which will be heated with electricity from renewable sources. These salts will be
directed to the steam generator where they will exchange heat with the water, generating the steam necessary to
reach a capacity of approximately 560 MW with both units in operation. The initiative will act as a large renewable
energy storage system, allowing to optimize its use by injecting energy at peak times such as at night, which
represents an excellent complement to solar and wind generation, plus the opportunity to offer inertia services and
provide flexible renewable capacity. Its development is intended to occupy a large part of the infrastructure and the
same power line of Angamos, so it does not involve any major modifications or interventions on the land.

d. Resolutions of the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on August 10, 2023
At the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting held on August 10, 2023, it was resolved to reduce the capital stock of
AES Andes from of AES Andes from US$ 1,975,633,416 to US$ 1,843,633,143, which is fully subscribed and paid. It
was agreed that the decrease of US$132,000,273 will be payable on December 19, 2023.
The AES Corporation through Inversiones Cachagua acquisition of AES Andes shares
Inversiones Cachagua SpA, through a tender offer for shares of AES Andes S.A. and through successive purchases in
the stock market in 2022 and 2023, increased its shareholding to 99.5% as of September 30, 2023.
Deconsolidation of Affiliate Alto Maipo
On November 17, 2021, AES Andes issued a new Material Fact in which it refers to the fact that AES Andes became
aware of the decision of its subsidiary Alto Maipo SpA (“Alto Maipo”), after reaching a pre-arranged agreement of
financial restructuring with its creditors, to start a reorganization process in the United States of America in accordance
with the regulations established in Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code. The entry application was
presented that same day by Alto Maipo in the pre-arranged modality. The foregoing, in order to achieve a capital
structure that is sustainable in the long term for Alto Maipo.
Taking into consideration the initiation of the Chapter 11 Procedure and the characteristics of Alto Maipo's capital
structure (including the existence of guarantees and subordination agreements for the benefit of Alto Maipo's senior
creditors), in accordance with what is established in paragraph 8 of International Financial Reporting Standard No. 10
(“IFRS 10”), the Company ceased to control Alto Maipo and, therefore, in accordance with what is established in
paragraph 25 of IFRS 10, ceased to consolidate this subsidiary, proceeding to write off in its Consolidated Financial
Statement, the assets and liabilities of the entity that has ceased to be a subsidiary. The Company recognized an
extraordinary net accounting loss associated with the loss of control attributable to the former controlling interest, of
approximately US$1,107 million dollars in the Consolidated Income Statement for the fourth quarter of 2021.
On May 26, 2022, Alto Maipo concluded its restructuring process. This restructuring included the execution of several
agreements and contractual modifications which main objective was to implement the Restructuring Agreement signed
on November 16, 2021 between the shareholders, the creditors and the contractor, approved by the Court overseeing
the Chapter 11 process.
At the end of the restructuring process, the Administration determined that the decision power over matters that most
significantly impact the economic performance of Alto Maipo is shared between lenders and shareholders, therefore
AES Andes does not control the Company and will continue to deconsolidate Alto Maipo upon emerging of the
reorganization process.
AES Andes' investment in Alto Maipo is classified under the category of Financial Assets at Fair Value Through Profit
or Loss in accordance with IFRS 9, paragraph 4.1.5. Based on the calculation developed by Management, considering
the capital structure resulting from the reorganization process and the nature of the financial agreements entered into,
the fair value of AES Andes' investment in Alto Maipo as of September 30, 2023 is zero.

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS BY MARKET
AES Andes operates a diverse portfolio of power generation and storage assets totaling 5.6GW in Chile, Colombia,
and Argentina as of September 30, 2023.
Chile
Chile’s National Electric System or SEN, supplies a wide range of customer types, including Chile’s main population
centers, in the center and mining operations in the north, with a diverse generation matrix including thermal, hydro and
other renewables. The SEN runs from the northern part of Region I to Region X. AES Andes was one of the leading
power producers on the SEN during the third quarter of 2023, operating 3.7GW of coal, hydro, biomass, wind and solar
plants, and 174MW of batteries.
Reservoir levels in the system at the end of the third quarter of 2023, were 102% higher, while hydrological inflows
during the quarter increased by 50% compared to the same period of 2022. Hydro generation increased 38% and solar
generation increased by 11%, while wind generation increased 1%. Average spot prices in the third quarter in Chile
were impacted by better hydrology due to higher rainfalls, lower coal, diesel and natural gas prices, higher Argentine
gas availability, in addition to the increase in renewable capacity in the system.
Total energy demand grew 1.3% compared to the same period of 2022, for an average monthly demand of 6,479 GWh
per month in the third quarter of 2023. The main reason for this increase is the 6.6% higher demand from unregulated
customers in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter in 2022, while demand from regulated customers
was 6.0% lower.
These factors led to a 22% decrease in the average marginal costs in the north and a 17% decrease in the central part
of the system compared to the third quarter of 2022.
AES Andes and its subsidiaries, produced 12% of the electricity on the SEN in the third quarter of 2023, while it
contributed 12% in the third quarter of 2022.
The table below shows the main SEN variables as of September 30, 2023, and 2022.

Average spot price Central Chile US$/MWh 96 116 121 145
In the third quarter of 2023, AES Andes’ sales revenues to unregulated customers decreased US$53 million due to a
decrease in contract prices partly offset by a 354GWh increase in sales volumes. Regulated customer contract
revenues fell by US$49 million, as a result of lower sales volumes of 120GWh, in addition to lower coal prices which
led to lower regulated contract prices. Meanwhile, revenues from the Spot market grew US$24 million as a result of a
278GWh increase in sales volumes, in addition to higher capacity revenues.
Transmission revenue increased US$4 million compared to the third quarter of 2022, which was offset by the increase
in transmission costs of US$4 million.

Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Other Operating revenue includes revenue from coal sales and services provided to companies within the AES Group.
Other Operating Revenues fell US$7 million mainly attributable to lower coal sales, in addition to the effect from the
valuation of derivatives associated with contracted energy sales. As a result of the drop in coal sales revenues in Other
Operating revenue, the cost of fuel sales decreased US$3 million.
During the third quarter of 2023, fuel consumption costs fell US$71 million compared to the same period of the
previous year due a 38% decrease in coal prices to 191 US$/ton, partly offset by a 167GWh increase in coal-fired
generation.
The 10% increase in coal-fired generation is explained primarily due to higher availability of all AES Andes' coal plants
in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, partly offset by lower dispatch. Hydro generation
decreased 19GWh due to certain unavailability at Volcán and Queltehues, despite the 18% increase in inflows
compared to the third quarter of 2022. Wind generation increased 2GWh primarily due to the start of operations of a
second stage at the Mesamávida wind farm during fourth quarter of 2022 and the start of operations at the Campo
Lindo wind farm in 2023, while solar generation increased 99GWh, primarily due to the incorporation of Bolero solar to
AES Andes assets and the start of operations at Andes Solar IIB in 2023.
Purchases of energy and capacity decreased US$31 million due to lower spot prices in the system, partly offset by the
162GWh increase in spot purchases volumes, in addition to the 101GWh increase in contracted purchases volumes
from other generators.
Other costs of fuel decreased US$2 million primarily due to lower coal handling costs.
The US$22 million increase in other cost of sales relates to the negative effects from the valuation of fuel costs
derivatives, higher charges from the system, higher maintenance costs, in addition to increased insurance premiums.
Depreciation decreased US$3 million due to lower depreciation at Norgener after the impairment registered in the
second quarter of 2023 as a consequence of the announcement of the disconnection of the plant as of December 31,
2025, partly offset by depreciation associated to the start of operations of Mesamávida and Campo Lindo and Andes
IIB.
Gross Profit in Chile in the third quarter of 2023 grew by 3% to US$91 million. The main positive variations includes an
increase in unregulated sales volumes and lower energy purchases costs in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the
same quarter of 2022, which were partly offset by lower regulated sales volumes and lower contract prices in line with
the decrease in coal prices which affect the price indexation of these contracts.

Colombia
AES Andes’ subsidiary, AES Colombia, operates 1,020MW of hydro and 109 MW of solar capacity and is one of the
main electric generators in the Colombian National Interconnected System or SIN, a predominantly hydro-based
system.
Affected by the El Niño weather pattern, system-wide inflows in Colombia during the third quarter of 2023 were lower
than in the third quarter of 2022, while they were higher in the basin where AES Colombia operations are located,
Chivor.
System-wide inflows were 18% above the historical average in the third quarter of 2022, while in 2023, third-quarter
inflows were 24% below average. Hydro conditions during the third quarter of the year, resulted in year-over-year
reservoir levels to decrease to 74% at the end of September 2023, 12% below than reservoir levels at the end of
September 2022.
Inflows for the catchment basin of Chivor during the third quarter of 2023 were 2% above the historical average, while
in 2022, third-quarter inflows were 15% below the historical average. The higher inflows between both quarters at
Chivor led to a 403GWh or 31% increase in hydro generation between the third quarter of 2023 and the same period of
2022.
In the third quarter of 2023, average spot market prices went up 304% in local currency and 338% in US Dollars,
compared to the same period in 2022 driven by system-wide lower inflows coupled with high hydrology volatility in the
system and inflows expectations in the coming months afected by the El Niño Phenomenon, in addition to higher
demand than expected and higher thermal generation.

During the third quarter of 2023, hydro generation at AES Colombia increased 403GWh compared to the same period
of 2022, as a result of wetter hydrology in the region Chivor plant is located and to take advantage of high spot prices
in the system. Solar generation increased 9GWh driven by the start of operations at Brisas Solar plant in December
2022.
In the third quarter of 2023, revenues in Colombia increased by US$165 million due to a US$161 million increase in
Spot revenue as a result of higher average spot prices, in addition to a 368GWh increase in spot sales volume.
Contract sales increased US$15 million primarily explained by the 93GWh increase in contract sales volume in addition
to the appreciation of the Colombian peso in the third quarter of 2023. Other revenues decreased US$11 million in the
third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022 as a result of a lower positive valuation of implicit derivative
instruments associated with contracted energy sales compared the third quarter of 2022.
The cost of energy and capacity purchases increased US$81 million. Higher average spot prices was the main driver
for this cost increase, in addition to a 52GWh increase in energy purchases under contract. Energy purchases from the
spot decreased 3GWh.

Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Transmission costs fell US$1 million due to a decrease in the allocation of auctions associated with transmission in the
areas were customers are located. Other costs of sales increased US$5 million due to other market charges (Ley 99,
FAZNI) as a consequence of the increase in generation, in addition to insurance and other fixed costs.
Gross Profit in Colombia for the third quarter of 2023 increased US$79 million compared to the same period last year,
primarily due to higher revenues from the spot market as a result of higher volume sales at higher average spot prices,
in addition to the positive impact on energy prices of the appreciation of the Colombian peso. This positive effect was
partly offset by a decrease in contract margins associated to higher energy purchases at higher prices.

Argentina
The Argentine Interconnected System or SADI is supplied primarily by natural gas-fired plants, in addition to hydro,
coal and nuclear power plants, and an ever growing amount of non conventional renewables. AES Andes’ subsidiary,
TermoAndes operates a 643MW gas-fired combined-cycle in northern Argentina selling electricity under two separate
frameworks: Energía Plus to commercial and industrial customers under US Dollar denominated contracts, and the
Energía Base regulated spot market framework. TermoAndes is also connected to The Andes solar hub on the SEN
grid in northern Chile via AES Andes’ InterAndes transmission line.
In February 2020, Argentina’s Secretariat of Energy issued Resolution 31/2020 establishing the current rates scheme.
Energía Base rates were established in Argentine pesos with monthly adjustments by inflation. The monthly inflation
adjustments were frozen in the early onset of the COVID pandemic. On May 29, 2021, Resolution 440/2021 was
issued which's main modification was a 29% inflation related increase in energy and capacity prices under the Energía
Base regime, retroactive from February 2021. On April 18, 2022, Resolution 238/2022 was issued, modifying the
established energy and capacity prices of Resolution 440/2021, applying tariff average increases of 30% from February
2022, and an additional 10% from June 2022 onwards. On December 12, 2022, Resolution 826/2022 was issued, once
again modifying energy and capacity prices prices under the Energía Base regime, increasing tariffs by 20% and 10%
since November 2022 and December 2022, respectively, in addition to establishing tariff increases in advance of 25%
and 28% from February 2023 and August 2023, respectively. On September 6, 2023 and on October 27, 2023, the
Ministry of Energy issued Resolutions 750/2023 and 869/2023, through which tariffs were increased by 23% and 28%
from September and November 2023, respectively.
On February 7, 2023, Resolution 59/2023 was issued allowing to convert part of combined cycles' remuneration to US
dollars for up to 5 years. This portion would be paid in Argentine pesos at the official exchange rate. The new
remuneration scheme is voluntary and the counterparty is the market administrator, CAMMESA, which requires an
availability commitment of 85% from the units. TermoAndes agreed to adhere to this new scheme in March 2023.
Updated capacity prices are 2,000 US$/MW-month plus 65% of capacity price set by Resolution 826/22 in winter and
summer, and 85% of said prices during spring and autumn. The price of energy generated is established at the
equivalent of 3.5 US$/MWh with natural gas and 6.1 US$/MWh with diesel.

During the third quarter of 2023, TermoAndes’ generation decreased 268GWh compared to the same period of 2022,
as a result of lower dispatch, in addition to lower Bolivian gas availability in Argentina.
Energía Plus contract revenues decreased US$1 million due to lower contract prices, while energy sales volumes grew
64GWh.
Energía Base spot market revenues decreased US$1 million as a result of 268GWh lower spot sales volume due to
the lower generation mentioned earlier, partly offset by the increase in tariffs associated with Resolutions 826/2022,
59/2023 and 750/2023.
Energy and capacity purchases remained fairly stable at US$9 million, while energy purchases volumes increased

A US$1 million negative variance was registered in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the the same period in 2022
related to an insurance recovery recorded in 2022. Other costs of sales increased US$1 million primarily explained by
higher maintenance costs, insurance costs and tax expenses compared to the third quarter of 2022.
Quarterly Gross Profit in Argentina fell US$4 million driven by lower Energía Plus contract prices, lower Energía Base
sales due to lower dispatch at Termoandes, higher other higher maintenance costs, insurance costs and tax expenses,

Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Consolidated Operating Revenue
Operating Revenue grew US$83 million in the third quarter of 2023, compared to the same period in 2022, reaching
US$752 million. The increase was driven primarily by higher spot sales in Colombia and Chile, in addition to higher
contract sales in Colombia. Lower contract sales to regulated and unregulated customers in Chile, lower coal sales in
Chile, in addition to negative variations of the valuation of implicit derivative instruments associated with contracted
energy sales in Chile and Colombia partly offset these positive variations.
Consolidated Cost of Sales
Cost of Sales increased US$5 million in the third quarter of 2023. Higher energy and capacity purchases in Colombia,
along with increased insurance, IT and system charges in Chile, Colombia and Argentina, were the primary drivers for
this increase. Lower coal prices which led to lower fuel costs in Chile despite the increase in coal generation, in
addition to the decrease in Energy and capacity purchases in Chile as a result of lower spot prices, partly offset the
negative variations.
Consolidated Gross Profit
Gross Profit increased 48% to US$241 million in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. This
quarterly performance is explained by increases of US$79 million in Colombia and US$3 million in Chile, partly offset
by the US$4 million decrease in Argentina.

AES Andes achieved an EBITDA of US$259 million in the third quarter of 2023, 37% higher that of the same period in
2022.
This positive variation is mainly explained by higher EBITDA contribution from Colombia, partly offset by lower
contributions from Chile and Argentina.
Chile’s quarterly EBITDA fell by US$3 million compared to the third quarter of 2022 due to lower regulated sales
volumes and a decrease in contract prices, partly offset by higher profits from unregulated sales as a result of an
increase in volume and lower energy purchase costs.
22
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Colombia’s quarterly EBITDA increased US$77 million due to higher spot sales volume at higher spot prices, in
addition to the appreciation of the Colombian peso, partly offset by lower contract margins associated to increased
costs of energy purchases.
Argentina’s EBITDA fell US$4 million driven by lower Energía Plus contract prices, lower Energía Base sales due to
lower dispatch at Termoandes, higher other higher maintenance costs, insurance costs and tax expenses, partly offset
by higher Energía Plus sales volumes.

The Company reported US$1 million in Other Gains in the third quarter of 2023 compared to US$2 million of Other
Gains in the same period of 2022, a US$1 million negative variance comparing both periods. The main driver for this
negative variance relates to a positive effect registered in the third quarter of 2022 in relation to the stabilization fund.
Financial Expenses grew US$21 million, primarily explained by higher financial debt at AES Colombia and AES Andes.
Financial Income increased US$19 million primarily as a consequence of higher interest earned in Argentina due to an
increase in financial investments at higher interest rates, and to a lesser extent, higher interests accrued in Chile from
the stabilization fund mechanism (MPC).
At AES Andes, Foreign currency exchange differences registered a US$57 million negative variation in the third quarter
of 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This variance is mostly related to the negative effect of the exchange
rate variation in the debt in Colombian pesos held by AES Andes with its subsidiary AES Colombia, the valuation of
derivatives, in addition to the effect from the depreciation of the exchange rate over the net asset position in Chilean
pesos, and in Argentina, the negative effect of the depreciation of the Argentine peso over cash and accounts
receivables.
Results by readjustment units registered a positive variation of US$12 million between the third quarter of 2023
compared to the same period of 2022, explained by the fact that no readjustment was applied as of July 2023 due to
the change in functional currency from Argentine peso to US dollar at Termoandes in July 2023, as a consequence of
the current market regulation.

Between the third quarters of 2022 and 2023, income tax experienced a negative variance from an expense of US$36
million in the third quarter of 2022 to an expense of US$61 million in the same period of 2023. This variation is in line
with the increase in Pretax Income, in addition to the increase in the Income Tax Rate in Colombia from 35% to 38%.
Net Income
The Company reported a Net Income Attributable to AES Andes Shareholders of US$65 million for the third quarter of
2023, up US2 million compared to the Net Income Attributable to Shareholders of Parent of US$63 million in the third
quarter of 2022.
Non-Controlling Interests in net income grew US$1 million primarily due to higher Net Income at Chile Renovables SpA

including increased collections from the sale of credits related to the stabilization fund in Chile, and in Argentina higher
collections of an additional US$32 in received from CAMMESA. These positive effects were partly offset by a US$53
million increase in income taxes payments.

Net Investment Activities Cash outflows experienced an increase of US$22 million compared to the first nine months of
2022, totaling a US$443 million net outflow as of September 30, 2023. This was mainly due to the disbursement of
US$111 million for the purchase of Bolero Solar in 2023, lower VAT recovery and Termoandes insurance payments
received in 2022 for a total of US$23 million, in addition to lower proceeds form the sale of offices in Chile for US$10
million in 2022, partly offset by lower Purchase of Property, Plant & Equipment in 2023 of US$119 million.
Net Financing Cash outflows in the first nine months of 2023, totaled US$136 million as of September 30, 2023, which
negatively compares to the US$370 million inflow in the same period of 2022. The main drivers for this variation were
the US$542 million decrease in inflows from long-term borrowings compared to 2022, US$66 million higher interest
payments, a decrease in proceeds associated to suppliers financing of US$52 million, US$67 million lower
contributions from partners to the Company's renewable projects, and US$$29 million higher debt repayments
compared to the first nine months of 2022. These negative variations were partly offset by a US$256 million increase in
proceeds from short-term borrowings.
Financial Debt
As of September 30, 2023, AES Andes' debt totaled US$3,077 million, of which approximately 66% effectively had a
fixed interest rate. The remaining 34% of the Company’s debt is subject to variable interest rates.
As of September 30, 2023, approximately 84% of AES Andes’ debt was denominated in USD. Of the remaining debt,
1% was denominated in Chilean UF (former Eléctrica Santiago’s bonds) and 15% in Colombian pesos (including the
leasing executed by AES Colombia to finance the Tunjita Project, and corporate debt in Colombia).
In the second quarter of 2022, AES Andes increased the size of its Green Loan Facility by US$150 million to a total of
US$400 million. The Green Loan carries an interest rate of SOFR +175bps with semiannual amortizations and a final
maturity in November 2026. The proceeded of the loan are being used to fund the construction of renewable energy
projects.
The following table shows the Company's debt in detail and maturities for the following years. Interest rates for debt in
Colombian pesos (COP) are presented in original currency. Debt in Colombian pesos as well as debt subscribed in UF
do not have exchange rate derivatives. For referential purposes, the 6.5% consolidated interest rate is calculated

RISK ANALYSIS
MARKET AND FINANCIAL RISK
Market risks refers to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows vary due to a change in market prices. Market risk
include the following three categories: foreign currency risk, interest rate risk, and commodity price risk. Financial Risk
relates to the potential occurrence of events, which could have a negative financial impact on the Company and
specifically includes credit risk and liquidity risk.
Foreign Currency Risk
In Chile the functional currency is the US Dollar ("USD") given that its revenue, expenses, and investments in
equipment and debt are mainly denominated in or linked to the USD. Also, the Company is authorized to file and pay
its income taxes in Chile in USD. There is an exchange rate risk associated with any revenue, expenses, investments,
and debt denominated in any currency other than USD. The main items denominated in Chilean pesos ("CLP") are
some energy receivables and tax credits primarily associated with VAT.
As of September 30, 2023, AES Andes maintained several currency forwards with banks to mitigate its exposure to
foreign exchange variations related to the collection of energy sales. Even though most of the Company’s energy
supply agreements have USD denominated prices, payments are made in CLP at an exchange rate that is fixed for a
specific period of time.
At September 30, 2023, and given the Company's net asset position held in Chilean pesos, the impact of a 10%
devaluation in the exchange rate of the Chilean peso to the U.S. dollar at the end of the period would have generated a
negative impact of approximately US$13 million; however the Company maintains a loan denominated in Colombian
pesos and the impact of a 10% devaluation in the exchange rate of the Colombian peso to the U.S. dollar at the end of
the period would have generated a positive impact of approximately US$32 million. In the period ended September 30,
2023, approximately 76% of the Company's revenues and 75% of its cost of sales were denominated in U.S. dollars,
while in the period ended September 30, 2023 approximately 79% of revenues and 81% of cost of sales were
denominated in U.S. dollars.
In relation to Colombia, it should be noted that the functional currency of AES Colombia is the Colombian peso since
most of the subsidiary's revenues, particularly contract sales and spot market sales, and operating costs are mainly
linked to the Colombian peso.
As of September 30, 2023, contract and spot sales in Colombia represented 20% of the Company’s consolidated
operating revenue, compared to 17% during the same period of 2022 Additionally, AES Colombia’s dividends are
denominated in COP, although financial hedge instruments are used to fix the amount to be distributed in USD. Given
AES Colombia's net liability position in USD as of the end of September 2023, a 10% devaluation in the COP/USD
exchange rate would have generated a positive impact of approximately US$1 million to AES Andes’ net income.
The functional currency of AES Andes' Argentine subsidiaries is the Argentine Pesos. Given TermoAndes' net asset
position in USD as of September 30, 2023, a 10% devaluation in the ARS/USD exchange rate would have generated a
negative impact of approximately US$7 million in AES Andes’ net income. A further weakening of the Argentine peso
could cause a significant decrease in TermoAndes' operating results, cash flow, ability to pay dividends to AES Andes
and the value of its assets. Further weakening of the Argentine peso could cause a significant decrease in
TermoAndes' operating results, in its cash flow, in the ability to pay dividends to AES Andes and in the value of its
assets.
At the consolidated level, investments in new plants and maintenance equipment are mainly denominated in U.S.
dollars. Short-term investments associated with cash management are mainly made in U.S. dollars. At September 30,
2023,, 56% of investments and current account balances are denominated in U.S. dollars, 12% in Chilean pesos, 8%
27
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
in Colombian pesos and 24% in Argentine pesos. Cash balances denominated in Argentinean pesos are subject to the
volatility of the exchange rate of the Argentinean market. As of December 31, 2022, 48% of investments and current
account balances were denominated in U.S. dollars, 11% in Chilean pesos, 7% in Colombian pesos and 34% in
Argentine pesos.
The following table shows the composition of the debt by currency based on principal to be repaid, as of September
30, 2023, and December 31, 2022:
September 30,
2023 December 31, 2022
USD 84.0 % 85.0 %
U.F. 1.0 % 1.0 %
COP 15.0 % 14.0 %
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
changes in market interest rates. The Company’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates
primarily to the Company’s long-term debt obligations with variable interest rates.
AES Andes manages its interest rate risk by having a significant percentage of its debt at a fixed rate or with interest
rate swaps, to fix it.
The following table shows the composition of debt by type of interest rate as of September 30, 2023, and December
31, 2022.
September 30,
2023 December 31, 2022
Fixed or with Swap 66.0 % 65.0 %
Variable 34.0 % 35.0 %
As of September 30, 2023, a 10% increase in variable interest rates would have a US$12 million negative impact on
net income.
Fuel Price Risk
AES Andes is affected by the volatility of certain commodity prices. The fuels used by the Company, mainly coal is a
commodity with international prices set by market factors outside of the Company’s control. The price of fuel is a key
factor in plant dispatch and spot prices both in Chile and Colombia. Since AES Andes’ portfolio in Chile has a
significant component of thermal generation, fuel costs represent a significant portion of the cost of sales.
Currently, AES Andes’ contracted energy is balanced with energy generation of facilities with a high probability of
dispatch (efficient generation). A portion of the Company’s PPAs in Chile include clauses that adjust prices based on
variations in the price of coal according to index mechanisms and adjustment periods specified in each contract, in
order to mitigate the risk of major changes in the cost of fuel.
Based on the above exposed, a 10% increase in the cost of fuel is estimated to have not had a material impact on the
Company's profits as of September 30, 2023.
28
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Credit Risk
Credit risk relates to the credit quality of counterparties with which AES Andes and its subsidiaries establish
relationships. These risks are reflected primarily in accounts receivables and financial assets, including bank and other
deposits and other financial instruments.
With regards to accounts receivable, AES Andes’ counterparties in Chile are mainly distribution companies and high
solvency industrial customers, and a significant percentage of these customers or their parent companies have local
and or international investment-grade credit ratings. Additionally, sales by the AES Andes Group companies on the spot
market must be made to other generators, members of the National Electrical Coordinator, in accordance with the
economic dispatch determined by this entity.
In Colombia, AES Colombia performs risk assessments of its counterparties based on an internal credit quality
evaluation, which in some cases may include guarantees. In Argentina, the main counterparties are CAMMESA
(Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico S.A.) Argentina’s wholesale electric market administrator,
and large unregulated consumers with contracts under the Energía Plus program. TermoAndes carries out internal
credit evaluations of its unregulated customers.
Financial investments by AES Andes and its subsidiaries such as mutual funds, time deposits, and derivatives, are
executed with local and foreign financial institutions, which have national and or international credit ratings greater than
or equal to “A” under the S&P and Fitch scale and “A2” under the Moody’s scale. Similarly, derivatives for financial debt
are executed with first-class international entities. Cash, investment, and treasury policies direct the management of
the Company's cash portfolio and minimize credit risk.
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk relates to the funding requirements to meet payment obligations. The Company's objective is to maintain
a balance between continuity of funding and financial flexibility, through internally generated cash flows, bank loans,
bonds, short-term investments, committed credit lines, and uncommitted credit lines.
As of September 30, 2023, AES Andes had US$283 million in available funds including, cash and cash equivalents.
Meanwhile, as of December 31, 2022, AES Andes had a balance in liquid funds available of US$186, which includes
cash and cash equivalents. It should be noted that the balance of cash and cash equivalents includes cash, time
deposits with original maturity of less than three months, marketable securities, mutual funds corresponding to low-risk
investments in U.S. dollars with immediate availability, rights with repurchase agreements and trust rights. As of
September 30, 2023, AES Andes had US$200 million in committed lines of credit and approximately US$175
million of uncommitted and unused lines of credit.

Earnings Report - 3Q 23
OPERATIONAL RISKS
Operational risks relate to the possibility of future outages or deficiencies that can negatively affect the Company’s
strategic operational and or financial objectives.
Hydrology
AES Andes’ operations in Chile and Colombia may be affected by hydrological conditions, as hydrology is key to plant
dispatch and prices on both grids.
In Chile, the Company has identified specific mitigation measures in case the current hydrological situation is
maintained over time. AES Andes uses proprietary statistical models to evaluate the risks associated with its
contractual commitments. In general terms, AES Andes’ commercial strategy in Chile is to execute long-term contracts
for its efficient generation plants, maintaining other more expensive units as a backup.
In Colombia, the commercial strategy focuses on the optimal use of the reservoir with the general objective of
contracting on between on average 75% to 85% of the expected generation.
Currently, the efficient generation of AES Andes’ facilities is balanced with contracted volume, which mitigates most of
the exposure to hydrology variations.
Demand Risk
Demand and electricity consumption of AES Andes' customers and in the systems in which the Company has
operations are key variables for the Company's operating results and for determining market prices. AES Andes
mitigates the risk of demand variations through the execution of contracts with large customers including committed
levels of consumption ("Take or Pay"). Exposure to the demand of our customers is limited to the variation in
consumption of small commercial and industrial customers.
As previously mentioned, exposure to demand in the spot market is limited by the commercial strategy in Colombia
and Chile. In Argentina, TermoAndes is an efficient base load plant that is within the order of merit even in hours of
minimum system demand.
In Chile, particularly, the increase in supply associated with the irruption of solar and wind energy projects determined
during the last few years a significant drop in short (where particularly in 2022 they were affected by the rise in
commodity prices) and long term energy prices. The installation costs of these technologies have decreased
considerably in recent years, making them highly competitive with respect to traditional technologies. It is expected that
the competitive dynamics and price trends will continue in the future.
Risk on fuel supply
Coal purchases are made through periodic tenders inviting important international suppliers, awarding the supply to
competitive and backed companies. The purchases are made in advance in order to guarantee a substantial portion of
coal needs for the following year, leaving a margin that provides flexibility in case of deviation in the expected plants'
dispatch allowing the Company to capture market opportunities.
Fuel purchase policy is complemented by an inventory management that substantially mitigates the risk of not having
the fuel needed. Additionally, the policy implemented mitigates inventory devaluation risk, balancing timely supply and
actual consumption.

Operational Failures and Maintenance
Mechanical failures, accidents, planned or unplanned maintenance that affect the availability of the Company’s efficient
capacity could have a material adverse effect on results.
Although the Company regularly performs maintenance and operational improvements to its plants to guarantee the
commercial availability of all of them and maintains in force operational insurance policies, failures could eventually
occur that result in commercial unavailability. A significant period of unavailability in the Company's efficient plants,
either due to operational failures or maintenance (scheduled or unscheduled) could mean, in some hydrological
scenarios, that the fulfillment of the supply contracts is made through the purchase of energy in the spot market,
conditions that could increase operating costs, negatively affecting the results of AES Andes.
Projects under construction
The execution of the Company’s investment projects under development depends on numerous factors that could
defer from the original projections. These factors include increases in costs of construction or investment in equipment,
potential delays, difficulty in finding skilled labor, financing costs, and the effect of potential delays or difficulties in the
regulatory authorization and permit process, including potential litigation or lawsuits.
It should be noted that adequate project development includes making investments related to diverse project areas
such as studies, easements, land preparation and construction of roads, among others, before the approval and final
execution of the project.
Currently, power generation projects are facing a high level of opposition from organized groups or local communities.
The Company cannot ensure that this opposition will not affect projects under construction. In its interest of being a
good neighbor and according to its “Policy for Relations with Local Communities,” AES Andes, works to be locally
respected and valued by its excellent economic, social and environmental performance and its contribution to the
sustainable development to the communities where it operates.
Decoupling Risk
Given certain transmission restrictions in Chile due to the concentration of renewable energy plants, there may be
differences between injection and withdrawal prices (decoupling) that must be assumed by the generator, affecting the
Company's operating margins. Currently, there are energy supply contracts in which this risk cannot be transferred;
however, in new contracts with free customers, transfer clauses are included to mitigate this risk. It should be noted
that the enabling of the Cardones-Polpaico transmission line has completed the interconnection process between the
former SIC and the SING grids, contributing significantly to the leveling of prices in the North and Center of the country
and to the reduction of transmission limitations that generated local prices for the different nodes of the System. All this
contributes to a significant reduction of the risk associated with decoupling.
31
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Regulatory Risks
AES Andes, its subsidiaries and related companies are subject to several different aspects of regulation in the
countries in which they operate. The regulatory risk is related to potential modifications to the existing legislation that
could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.
AES Andes cannot guarantee that the laws or regulations in the countries in which it operates or has investments will
not be modified or interpreted in a manner that could adversely affect the Company or guarantee that governmental
authorities will grant any requested approval. AES Andes however actively participates in the development of the
regulatory framework, submitting comments and proposals to the proposed regulations presented by authorities.
Electricity Regulation
As power generation companies, AES Andes, its subsidiaries, and related companies are subject to regulation in
diverse aspects of their business. The current regulatory framework, which governs all electricity supply companies,
has been in effect in Chile since 1982 and in Colombia since 1994, while in Argentina the regulatory framework was
established by Law 15.336 from 1960 and Law 24.065 from 1992.
CHILE
Regulated Tariff Stabilization Mechanism
On July 13, 2022, a Bill that creates a stabilization fund and establishes a new mechanism of temporary stabilization of
electricity prices for customers under regulated contracts "MPC" (Client Protection Mechanism" also known as "PEC
2") was approved by the Deputy Chamber. The new mechanism, unlike its predecessor, does not alter the prices of
regulated supply contracts, nor allocates the financing cost to the supplier, but establishes a discount to the monthly
invoicing made by the generation companies to the distribution companies. This discount will be returned to the
supplier on a monthly basis by issuing a payment document "Transferable credit title", guaranteed by the Chilean
Treasury. This transferable credit title must be issued by the Ministry of Finance, incorporating the Monetary Policy
Rate published by the Central Bank of Chile plus 25 basis points, which must be adjusted by the Ministry of Finance in
accordance with the market conditions in force at the time of issuance of the payment document.
Likewise, the bill establishes different ranges of tariff stabilization, being the customers with lower regulated
consumption in terms of kWh/month the most benefited, as well as the micro and small businesses up to a monthly
consumption of 1,000kWh.
The tariff stabilization fund will be financed by the establishment of a new single charge, for unregulated and regulated
customers, with different value according to consumption levels, being exempt from this charge consumption lower
than 350kWh/month. This Tariff Stabilization Fund, as well as the charges to finance it, will have a single validity that
may not exceed December 31, 2032, and may not be extended beyond that period. Likewise, the law establishes that
the balances generated by the stabilization of tariffs must be extinct no later than December 2032, being able to set for
such purpose, additional charges in the regulated rate setting "MPC Charges" (Mechanism Charge for Customer
Protection).
Finally, it is established that the "MPC Charges" must be imputed as a priority to the payment of the uncollected
balances of the previous price stabilization mechanism (of Law No. 21,185 or "PEC 1").
Law No. 21,472 was published on August 2, 2022, however, the first payment documents of the MPC mechanism were
not finalized until August 30, 2023, partly due to the significant delay in the issuance of Tariff Decrees. These delays, in
addition to negatively affecting the implementation of the MPC mechanism, entail a significant accumulation of debt on
the part of regulated customers, which will lead to inevitable future tariff increases, so the Ministry of Energy decided to
postpone the publication of the tariff decrees of January 2023 and July 2023, pending the development of a new
complementary mechanism to the MPC mechanism, which will allow mitigating the aforementioned increases.

Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Discussion Complementary Mechanism for Stabilization of Regulated Rates and Subsidies
On October 11, 2023, the Minister of Energy addressed in the Mining and Energy Commissions of both Chambers of
Congress, the future increases in electricity tariffs and their implications, derived from an accelerated exhaustion of the
MPC mechanism, and the delay in the timely issuance of tariff decrees.
In this context, the Ministry of Energy and the Senate Mining and Energy Commission signed an agreement to work on
a new electricity tariff stabilization mechanism. The commitment is to continue with the processing of the energy
transition bill through the entry of a series of indications that, among other measures, will advance in the creation of a
subsidy for vulnerable customers and will allow the execution of urgent expansion works for the electricity system.
It is expected that during November 2023, the Ministry will present a new bill to address future tariff increases through
a new tariff stabilization scheme and a targeted subsidy scheme for the most vulnerable regulated customers. The
discussion will have among its main focuses 1. the origin of the financing of the new mechanism and 2. the financing of
the subsidy required for vulnerable customers.
Flexibility Strategy, reform of the power market.
In November 2019, the Ministry of Energy presented the Flexibility Strategy with the objective of defining a regulatory
work plan for the short and medium term related to the operational flexibility of the system. The strategy considers the
development of a process with the following three work axes:
a. Improvement of the market design for the development of a flexible system.
b. Review of the regulatory framework for storage systems.
c. Measures associated with the flexible operation of the system.
The agenda of the process contemplated a regulatory discussion that would extend from January 2020 to May 2022.
During this process, the review of the current remuneration mechanism and its price level was proposed.
In September 2020, the Ministry of Energy restarted the regulatory work associated with the development of the
Flexibility Strategy. Likewise, on October 15, discussions began on the strategy's axis: improvement of the market
design for the development of a flexible system. The work contemplates the modernization of the capacity market with
a view to the future flexibility needs of the system, foreseeing different impacts on the level of payment of various
technologies. The participatory regulatory work, led by the Ministry of Energy, was completed during July 2021.
On September 3, 2021, the Ministry published for public consultation a draft of the new power payment regulation,
which was closed for comments on October 5, 2021. The document under consultation would contemplate a
transitional period of approximately 9 years to fully migrate to the new power payment regime, counted from the date of
publication of the new regulation. The document under consultation would contemplate methodological changes that
would apply immediately after the new regulation is published and additionally a potential impact on the power
remuneration price.
On February 17, 2022, The Ministry of Energy entered Supreme Decree No. 3/2022 for processing by the Comptroller
General of the Republic, which establishes a new regulation for the capacity market. However, on September 21, 2022,
by means of Official Communication No. 1352 of the Ministry of Energy, the Regulation was withdrawn from the
Comptroller's Office by the Undersecretary of Energy.
In relation to the above, the Ministry of Energy after the conformation of work tables with the main unions of the sector,
in order to address the assumptions of temporary application of the new power regulation, contained in Supreme
Decree No. 3 of 2022 (withdrawn from comptroller's office), in a public presentation on January 24, 2023 has indicated
the main changes that the new version of the transitional chapter of the regulation would contain. The Ministry of
33
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Energy points out in its presentation that the new version will include a mechanism that allows generation plants to opt,
for one time only, subject to application conditions, to the recognition of sufficiency power based on the Supreme
Decree N°62/2006 or to migrate to the mechanism of recognition of power based on the new methodology established
in the proposed regulation. In this way, a plant that opts for the first scheme will be able to maintain said methodology
of recognition of sufficiency power for 15 years from the date of entry into operation of the plant.
Likewise, the Ministry has communicated that it will include an administrative recognition of payment for power to
storage systems with or without a transitional renewable plant based on a table that will be in force for 10 years from
the publication of the regulation. After the 10 years of application, a gradual transition mechanism of 5 years will be
implemented, weighting the recognition rule of the table and the power recognition provided by the new methodology
(probabilistic) of the regulation.
Finally, on July 27, 2023, the Ministry of Energy has announced that it will desist from the processing of the New Power
Regulation, starting the processing of changes limited to the current regulation Supreme Decree No. 62. The main
implication is that the new ELCC probabilistic methodology will not be implemented to determine the sufficiency
contribution of generating units and storage, which generated high uncertainty for renewable technologies and storage.
The changes to the current power regulation are mainly framed in establishing an administrative recognition to the
payment of power storage for 10 years from the publication of the changes in the official gazette. It also establishes the
need for a technical study by the Coordinator that will serve as input for the regulator to then establish peak control
schedules based on the most demanding times of the system. The document in public consultation of modification to
the DS N°62 was in force from July 26 to August 28, 2023. In this context, on October 20, 2023, the Ministry of Energy
responded to the comments made in the framework of the public consultation. The main changes and clarifications
published are related to making viable the recognition of payment for power to storage systems, as well as redefining
the percentages of payment recognition during the first ten years to storage systems, highlighting the contribution of
storage between 3 and 5 hours of duration.
The Ministry estimates that the new decree will begin to be processed by the Comptroller's Office during November
2023.
Portability Bill
On September 10, 2020, the Ministry of Energy has presented the Electric Portability Bill to start the legislative
process. The bill was referred to the Mining and Energy Commission and the Treasury Commission. The aim of the
project is to enable all end users to choose their supplier of electricity, getting lower prices, differentiated and
personalized offers, and better quality in customer service. Currently the project is not considered urgent and is in the
first stage of legislative processing. To date, it has not been added to the Commissions' agenda for discussion.
Bill that prohibits the installation and operation of coal-fired thermoelectric plants
On January 9, 2020, a bill that prohibits the installation and operation of coal-fired thermoelectric plants throughout the
country was presented by a parliamentary motion. This bill establishes the prohibition of installation and closure of
coal-fired plants in Chile no later than December 31, 2025.
On June 22, 2021, both the permanent article and the transitory article, which is the one that determines the deadline
for the closure of the plants, have been approved in their first legislative procedure in a vote in the Chamber of
Deputies of the Chamber of Deputies.
On October 13, 2021, the Senate Chamber took note of the entry of the motion of a group of Senators, initiating a bill
that promotes the generation of renewable energy (Bulletin No. 14,652-08), for discussion in the Mining and Energy
Committee of the Senate. The bill prohibited the injection into the National Electric System, as from January 1, 2030, of
34
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
electric energy whose primary source is the combustion of fossil substances. On March 15, 2022, the bill was
approved in general by the Senate. The Senate Mining and Energy Commission of the Senate still has to approve the
bill and then the House of the Senate to complete the first stage of the legislative process. As of the date of issuance of
these Financial Statements, it has not been placed on the table of the Committees for discussion.
Water Code Reform
On April 6, 2022, Law No. 21,435 reforming the Water Code (the "Reform") was published in the Official Gazette and
entered into force. Although the Reform reaffirms the nature of water use rights ("WURs") as a real right, it
contemplates causes of expiration for non-use, introduces obligations for WURs owners, and establishes that the new
WURs that are created will have time limits, up to 30 years, which can be automatically extended.
Priority or preference is given to subsistence, human consumption and sanitation uses over other productive uses,
both for the granting of WURs and for limitations on their exercise. The Reform also establishes the human right to
water and sanitation. It also grants the General Water Directorate (DGA), among others:
• powers to impose water redistribution measures, always guaranteeing the prioritization of human consumption,
sanitation and domestic subsistence uses in certain areas in the event of insufficient water resources; new
powers of the DGA in relation to declarations of water scarcity areas;
• and the power to establish minimum ecological flows for new WURs, as well as in the case of transfers of the
exercise of a WURs and with respect to existing WURs in areas declared under official biodiversity protection.
The Reform establishes the creation of Strategic Water Resources Plans that seek to promote water security
for each basin.
The Reform establishes the creation of Strategic Water Resources Plans that seek to promote water security for each
basin, which has begun to be implemented through the Basin Councils, generating a participatory stage in the
Strategic Plans.
On the other hand, the Reform also establishes restrictions to the exercise of an AD in case of affecting an aquifer or
surface water source, and furthermore, that the MOP may expropriate rights both to satisfy domestic needs of a
population and to satisfy the conservation of water resources, when there are no other means to obtain water. In
addition, the reform prohibits the constitution of water rights in glaciers, establishes grounds for the extinction of water
rights for non-use and creates in situ use for conservation or tourism purposes and finally, in the area of groundwater, it
encourages the organization of water communities with respect to the declaration of prohibition and restriction zones.
Law that "Regulates Wind Power Complexes and Photovoltaic Plants".
On October 12, 2022, a parliamentary motion has been introduced to amend Law No. 19,300 and regulate in a special
way the construction of wind turbine complexes and photovoltaic plants" (Bulletin No. 15412-12). The project seeks, on
the one hand, greater citizen participation in the development of the projects, regulate the minimum distance between
wind turbines and houses, regulate the flickering shadow effect in wind towers, as well as contemplate fines for non-
compliance.
On July 31, 2023, by means of Official Letter No. 18,632, the Chamber of Deputies approved the request of the
Environment and Natural Resources Committee to merge the previous bill with another bill submitted which states:
"Regulates the construction of wind turbine complexes and modifies the law on general environmental bases" (Bulletin
No. 14443-12). As of the date of issuance of these Financial Statements, it has not been placed on the table of the
Committees for discussion.

National Electric System Chain of Payment
On September 29, 2022 the company Maria Elena Solar (subsidiary of Solar Pack) informed the Coordinator that it
would not be possible to meet its payment obligations in the short-term market from July onwards. Likewise, on
October 6, Ibereolica Cabo Leones II informed that it was in the same situation for its obligations since August.
Both companies have regulated contracts awarded in public auction processes in which their bids for solar and wind
projects were awarded.
The National Electric Coordinator (CEN) has taken the necessary steps to execute the short-term market guarantees
mechanism established in the regulation to pay the amounts owed by the companies. The companies provided
guarantees for US$3.7 million for the year 2022 to CEN.
The situation that would cause the alleged insolvency of the companies would be related to the exposure to high
marginal withdrawal costs for their contracts, and the impact on the valuation of their injections due to the congestion
present in the system.
Due to the high overall volume of regulated energy contracted and the low volume of these 2 suppliers (around 2% of
regulated supply), the eventual early termination of these contracts would not represent a supply risk or the need for
new short-term tenders, and would have a limited impact on regulated tariffs to end customers.
Regarding the status of the regulated contracts of these companies, the distribution companies may terminate the
contract in advance, prior authorization of the National Energy Commission. In this regard, on November 24, 2022,
through official letter 736/2022 CNE has indicated that it does not approve the early termination of supply contracts, in
response to the request made by the distribution company CGE. Likewise, CNE by means of official letter 752/2022
indicates that the exclusion of supply allocation for the balance of transfers of suspended contracts of the Short Market
does not represent the recognition of the termination of the validity of these contracts. It also mentions that the higher
purchase costs, originated in the higher effective billings of the suppliers' contracts, will be recognized in the following
Technical Reports of Average Node Prices. On the other hand, on January 3, 2023, the Superintendence of Electricity
and Fuels through Ordinary Official Letter 154727, pointed out Ibereólica Cabo Leones II S.A. ("Ibereólica"), failed to
comply with the instruction to deliver the information requested in relation to the payment chain in the short term
market in the context of what is established in the electricity law, with which it formulates charges for the facts
constituting an infraction.
On July 12, 2023, Ibereólica Cabo Leones II returns to the short-term market by settling outstanding balances with the
Coordinates and providing a new guarantee to the National Electric Coordinator in the amount of US$3.5 million.
Also, on July 14, 2023, through Resolución Exenta No. 292, the CNE approved the early termination due to major force
of the regulated supply contracts of Huemul Energía SpA (Mainstream) supported by the Ckani project. The contract
involved an amount of 374 GWh/year at a current price of 52.1 USD/MWh, and was supposed to be supported by the
109 MW Ckani wind project, which faced construction difficulties of the archaeological type cataloged as force majeure.
In relation to the above, the Regulator has carried out three actions:
• In the bases of the current auction for the Supply of Regulated Clients 2023/01, a series of modifications have
been included with respect to the previous processes, with the purpose of minimizing the market risks that the
future suppliers of these contracts will face. The main measures include a geographic segmentation of the
amounts to be bid, in addition to the hourly segmentation of supply currently contemplated. Likewise, the
transfer of systemic costs directly to the final customer is contemplated, such as, for example: payments for
complementary services and cost overruns due to non-economic operations. Finally, the auction process
includes direct incentives that favor the awarding of renewable energy offers that include energy storage
capacity.
36
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
• Within the framework of the energy transition bill, it is proposed to incorporate a new compensation mechanism
in favor of regulated customers affected by the suspension of suppliers of regulated contracts of the Short-
Term Market. The amount of the indemnity would be calculated by the CNE considering the projection of the
tariff effect that the suspension in the energy and power balance would have on regulated customers for a
period of 12 months following the suspension. Additionally, the payment of this indemnity would be a new
condition for the supplier to be able to return to the short-term market, once all debts to the rest of the balance
participants have been settled and a new guarantee to participate in the short-term market has been issued.
• Likewise, within the framework of the energy transition bill, it is proposed to incorporate a new mechanism for
the reallocation of Extraordinary Tariff Revenues for the benefit of contracted companies with higher price
differentials between injection and withdrawal from the spot market.
Additionally, the structure of the energy market and complementary services of the Chilean electricity sector will be
analyzed, based on studies initiated by the National Energy Commission and the Ministry of Energy during the year
2023.
Green Taxes
The Ministry of Finance has announced that it will present a corrective tax bill focused on modifying the current green
tax regime. The reform would be presented during the month of May 2023 and would contemplate modifications to the
current value of the tax, as well as its treatment in the electricity market.
In relation to such reform, both AES Andes and the Generators Association have pointed out to the Ministry that the
modification of the tax must contemplate an adequate gradualism regime and a known trajectory, in order to encourage
the adaptation of the system in its transition to a green matrix. Likewise, the tax should be incorporated in the variable
cost of the generating units, in order to minimize the short-term impact on the system, thus eliminating the need for the
current compensation mechanism.
Within the measures contained in the document "Initial Agenda for a second phase of the energy transition", the
Ministry of Energy announced the elimination of the compensation called "Compensation B", which determines the
hourly compensation in those hours in which by instruction of the Coordinator the generating units have injected
energy to the system at a variable operating cost higher than the marginal cost, thus eliminating the largest proportion
of current compensations, to the detriment of the inter-annual margin of the generating companies that must pay taxes
on emissions.
In this context, on March 18, 2023, the National Energy Commission issued Exempt Resolution N°149, by which it left
without effect Resolution N°52, dated January 31, 2018, which complements and modifies Resolution N°659 of 2017,
which establishes technical provisions for the implementation of Article 8° of Law N°20,780.
It also establishes that the modification will be applicable from the preparation of the Balances of Offsets that the
National Electric Coordinator must publish in 2024, with the purpose of making the calculations to determine the offsets
for payment of the tax on emissions associated with the operation of the generating companies throughout the year
2023.
As of the date of this report, AES Andes and other generation companies are evaluating the legal remedies to be filed
to challenge the decision of the authority, in order to reinstate the regulatory provisions that allow the proper
implementation of the green tax compensation established in the final paragraph of Article 8 of Law 20,780.
Draft Energy Transition Law
On July 11, 2023, the "Energy Transition Bill" was introduced for discussion in the first legislative procedure in the
Mining and Energy Commission of the Senate.
37
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
The bill is part of a set of measures of the Ministry of Energy within the framework of the so-called "Initial Agenda for a
second phase of the energy transition".
Thus, the content of this bill is framed in three pillars:
a. Efficient development of transmission works.
b. Electricity Sector and Climate Change.
c. Competition and promotion of storage.
Among the main measures established in the bill are the following:
a. Auction of a one-time large-scale Storage System, to be carried out by the National Energy Commission. The
Storage System would be fully remunerated by end users, for a maximum term of 15 years, as established in
the auction terms & conditions, which should be carried out during 2024 according to the terms of the bill.
b. New Extraordinary Tariff Revenue Reallocation Mechanism for the benefit of contracted companies with higher
price differentials between injection and withdrawal from the spot market.
c. Enabling the participation of transmission companies in the generation segment, according to maximum
participation thresholds to be defined by the Court for the Defense of Free Competition.
d. New definition of Peak Demand, according to the electric demand in the period of highest power demand in the
year, replacing the concept of maximum power in the annual load curve. With power impact on the
determination of the size of the power market.
e. New Compensation Mechanism for regulated customers due to the suspension of suppliers from the Short-
Term Market. This would also be a new condition for the supplier to return to the short term market.
f. New coordination principle: "Operation of a low-emission system".
g. Modifications to the National Energy Planning and Modifications to the Transmission Planning process.
National Energy Plan every 8 years including regional plans and Transmission Planning would be bi-annual
(now annual), with expansion decrees every one year.
On October 11, 2023, in the context of the discussion of future tariff increases, the Ministry of Energy and the Senate
Mining and Energy Committee signed an agreement to work on a new electricity tariff stabilization mechanism. The
commitment also addresses continuing with the processing of the energy transition bill through the entry of a series of
indications that, among other measures, will advance in the creation of a subsidy for vulnerable customers and will
allow the execution of urgent expansion works for the electricity system.
Thus, the Ministry of Energy has proposed to restructure the energy transition project, prioritizing to legislate the
following issues:
a. Storage Tendering
b. Improvements associated with the transmission segment
c. Reallocation of Tariff Revenues
d. Tariff protection mechanism for vulnerable customers.
The specific discussion will be carried out, in a pre-legislative stage during October and November of this year, through
a series of technical tables between the authorities and representatives of the sector.
Renewable Quotas Law
On October 26, 2022, the Ministry of Energy has restarted the discussion of the bill that "Promotes the participation of
renewable energies in the national energy matrix", before the Mining and Energy Commission of the Chamber of
Deputies. In this context, on December 13, 2022, the executive has formulated indications to the original bill increasing
the annual quota of non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) to 60% by 2030 (the current quota is 20% by 2025)
and establishing a quota of NCRE compliance in temporary blocks with a goal of 40% by 2030. For both goals a
38
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
gradual staggered compliance is established from 2023 to 2030 and would only apply to new supply contracts signed
as of January 1, 2023, for which reason the risk of non-compliance is estimated to be low.
Likewise, the bill establishes the obligation for CEN to maintain an energy tracking and registration system through
public traceability of energy from origin to end, as well as increasing the limit for distributed generation up to 500kW
(currently 300kW), increasing the potential for residential self-generation which could imply a lower energy
consumption by regulated customers.
On April 3, 2023, the bill was approved in general and particular in the Chamber of Deputies in its first legislative
procedure. Regarding its second legislative procedure, on April 17, 2023, the Senate Mining and Energy Committee
agreed to hold three sessions to analyze the bill, assigning the first session to the presentation of Minister Pardow, the
second session to receive organizations that have requested a hearing and the third session to vote in general. As of
the date of this report, it has not been placed on the table of the Committees for discussion, prioritizing the discussion
of the "Energy Transition Bill" described at the end of this report.
As of the date of issuance of these Financial Statements, it has not been placed on the table of the Committees for
discussion, prioritizing the discussion of the "Energy Transition Bill" described at the end of this report.
Bill that "Allows to ensure water certainty for the different productive uses of water"
On November 16, 2020, a bill was presented to "Ensure water certainty for the different productive uses of
water" (Bulletin No. 13,891-09), which amends the Water Code and the General Law on Electric Utilities.
The bill seeks to prioritize the use of consumptive water rights for irrigation, sanitation and human consumption with
respect to non-consumptive water rights, as well as to establish that the electric concessionaires of hydroelectric power
plants must present within 5 years following the entry into force of the law, a plan for the transformation of their
productive matrix in which they must consider the use of renewable sources, other than water, that ensure the
sustainable use of the detained water reserves. It also establishes that the concessionaires will have to refrain from
carrying out generation work when injecting energy or power to the system through the use of water as the basis of
their activity, when this would be detrimental to the irrigators who obtain water from the same source or its tributaries.
To this end, electricity generation must be coordinated with the irrigation activity.
In the case of territories under a water shortage decree, concessionaires will not be able to generate unless they do so
simultaneously with the holders of rights for human consumption, sanitation or irrigation or with the authorization of the
users' organizations, and as long as it does not affect the future availability of the resource.
The current drafting of the law project would be focused on regular conflicts occurring between the hydroelectric
generation of reservoir and water rights for agricultural and residential use. The bill is currently in its first constitutional
proceeding, without urgency, awaiting the first report of the Special Commission on Water Resources, Desertification
and Drought, and it is expected that after the presentations made by the associations of the electric sector, the real
meaning and scope of the provisions of the bill will be clarified.
Watershed Governance
According to the Public Account 2022, the Government of Chile is interested in Basin Governance through the Basin
Councils, composed of a public-private board representing different stakeholders in the basins, whether or not they
have water use rights. The objective of this is to establish basin planning, generate, promote and coordinate the
integrated management of water resources.
At the regulatory level, this has been framed within the Interministerial Committee for Just Water Transition (CITHJ),
created by Decree 58/2022, led by the Ministry of the Environment. The pilot basins from north to south are: Codpa
39
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
and Caleta Vitor, Pampa del Tamarugal, Salar de Atacama, Huasco, Choapa, Ligua, Maipo, Rapel, Maule, Biobío,
Toltén, Valdivia, Maullín, Aysén, Coastal Basins between Seno Andrew and R. Hollemberg and islands to the east.
The plan is currently divided into the following stages:
• Preparation for the installation of the pilot Basin Councils, through the technical units and coordination of the
regional governments.
• The installation of pilot Basin Councils, through technical secretariats and Basin Council assemblies.
• The preparation of the Basin Councils law, which is in the process of defining the methodology for the
participation of the pilot Basin Councils with the greatest progress, on the verge of being introduced as a bill.
Regarding progress, the councils continue to be promoted through meetings with relevant stakeholders.
Constitutional Assembly
On December 12, 2022, the main political parties signed the Agreement For Chile, which establishes the framework for
the new constituent process and will conclude with a plebiscite in November 2023. The following bodies will participate
in the constitutional process:
a. Constitutional Commission: composed of 50 popularly elected members, which includes indigenous members
and which, in order to approve, require a 2/3 quorum;
b. Commission of Experts: Composed of 24 experts, of which 12 are appointed by the Senate and 12 by the
Chamber of Deputies, which must prepare an initial draft of the new Constitution, acting with a quorum of 3/5 of
its members.
c. Admissibility Commission: Composed of 14 experts proposed by the Chamber of Deputies and appointed by
the Senate, who may declare that a proposal is not in line with the basic principles of the constitutional
agreement and require that a new proposal be drafted.
The appointment of the members of the Commission of Experts took place in January 2023 and the election of the
members of the Constitutional Council on May 7, 2023. The Expert Commission delivered the final text of the draft
Constitution on June 5 to the Constitutional Council, which must review it by November 7 and then proceed to the
mandatory plebiscite on December 17, 2023.
The Company continues to monitor the evolution of the political process in order to assess regulatory risks that could
affect the performance of its operations.
COLOMBIA
Transitional measures for the commercialization of energy for the regulated market.
On September 18, 2023 Resolution CREG 701 021 of 2023 was published, where several adjustments are proposed:
i) to reduce from 66 to 31 days the execution of the SICEP (Centralized Information System of Public Calls) ii) to
establish a transitional contract in a 75% pay what is contracted mode that must be signed by generators that have
surpluses between their firm energy and their contracts and may only be transferred to the end user at a regulated
price of 1. 5 times the average of the contracting prices of the period, which provides relief so that the demand does
not continue to buy energy at high exchange prices but would limit the opportunity income of the generators in critical
periods such as the El Niño phenomenon.

Procedures for monitoring spot market exchange offers
On September 1, 2023, CREG Circular 068 of 2023 was published, where the procedures that make operable the
scheme for "monitoring the exercise of market power in bid prices" were made public of article 3 of Resolution CREG
101-018 of 2023. Once the procedures are published, the National Dispatch Center (CND) may start the application of
tests.
Change to CREG's internal regulations
On September 26, 2023, Resolution CREG 105-003 of 2023 was published, which issued the new internal regulations
of the CREG. This new regulation reduces the quorum required to meet and adopt decisions in the Commission; in
addition, it allows commissioners who decide to save their vote to argue the reason for their decision. With respect to
the Commission's decisions, the Minister or his delegate may submit observations to the CREG for review, in the case
of formal, numerical or wording errors or requests for clarification of the approved modifications.
Social dialogue to define the Roadmap for a Just Energy Transition
The government program proposes a Just Energy Transition, with national goals and territorial vision. The main
challenges recognized in this government program are three:
1. the adaptation of energy systems to the adverse consequences of climate change,
2. the transition from an extractive economy to a productive economy, and the
3. the establishment of social and ecological justice, in which energy is established as a universal right.
This seeks to turn Colombia into a global leader and benchmark in the adaptation of energy systems to meet the needs
of the population and simultaneously address the environmental crisis caused by global warming. The Just Energy
Transition is based on four principles: equity; gradualness, sovereignty and reliability; binding social participation; and
knowledge.
AES Colombia has had direct participation in the discussions before the national government and also through the
representation of associations such as Acolgen, Andesco and Ser Colombia.
National Development Plan 2022-2026
The government enacted Law 2294 containing the National Development Plan 2022-2026 and where electricity
transfers were increased from 1% to 6% of gross energy sales for generation from non-conventional renewable
resources. It will be applied exclusively to those plants located in areas with higher solar radiation and wind speed as
established by the Ministry of Mines and Energy. Through trade union intervention, the transfers for non-conventional
renewable resources will remain at 4% for those projects that have previous commitments with the market either in the
reliability charge or in long-term energy contracts.
Regulated tariffs
In view of the increase in public utilities above inflation, the Ministry of Mines and Energy, the Energy and Gas
Regulatory Commission (CREG) and the Superintendency of Public Utilities have issued resolutions aimed at
modifying some components of the tariff formula.
Through Resolution CREG 101-027, energy distribution and transmission companies may adjust the value of the
regulated charge by updating the indexation indicator (the minimum between CPI and PPI). Resolution CREG 101-028
seeks to optimize the operation of thermal plants by dispatching them more efficiently and reducing the cost of
41
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
electricity restrictions. Finally, Resolution CREG 101-029 established the guidelines for generating agents to voluntarily
renegotiate current energy contracts by adjusting the indexation indicators.
As a result of the contract negotiation process to date, end users will be able to see a reduction in the tariff between
4% and 8% of its value due to the fact that only 69% of all contracts were renegotiated. AES Colombia voluntarily
adjusted 100% of the regulated market contracts for the remainder of 2022 and until the third quarter of 2023, with the
exception of its long-term contracts, which were not adjusted.
In the medium term, it is expected that a new contract indexation indicator will be defined specifically for the electricity
sector, which will allow for greater tariff stability in the country.
Market Operation Code
The objective with the issuance of the draft of the new operating code contained in Resolution CREG 143 of 2021 is to
establish the applicable regulation for the proper functioning of the wholesale energy market and the interaction
between the agents that participate in it, seeking that the transactions of electric energy and other products and
services of the market respond to criteria of efficiency and free competition.
The main proposed adjustments to the market are as follows:
i. to have a market of binding commercial commitments that can be adjusted in sessions close to the operation;
ii. implementing a co-optimization process for energy and ancillary services in the daily dispatch;
iii. provide firm price signals for energy and other services before the operation in real time;
iv. establish a scheme to regulate the behavior of generators;
v. establish mechanisms for demand to actively participate in the market through bids;
vi. establish competitive mechanisms for the allocation and remuneration of complementary services: secondary
and tertiary regulation and autonomous start-up;
vii. enable the participation of new technologies alongside conventional technologies in the energy and
complementary services market.
It is expected to have a period of adjustments and comments to the proposed schemes among all market participants
given that there will be a year until the implementation once the final resolution is issued. AES Colombia is working with
an expert consultant to analyze the impacts of the implementation of the regulation and training the teams to carry out
simulations of binding and intraday dispatch.
Calculation of firm energy for wind and photovoltaic solar plants
The regulator issued a draft resolution to modify the methodology for calculating the firm energy from wind and
photovoltaic solar resources, which contemplate requesting the basic parameters of these resources in order to obtain
a centralized modeling that allows these projects to participate in allocations of firm energy obligations under the
reliability charge scheme. In principle these projects would not affect the firm energy obligations already acquired by
AES Colombia's projects.
Adjustments in the start of operation dates for generation projects
The CREG presented a regulatory proposal to modify CREG resolution 075 of 2021 in order to include a new condition
that allows modifying a generation project start of operations date, if and only if, has an execution progress greater
than 60%. This option can only be claimed once and the maximum additional term granted for the start of operation will
be up to one year.
42
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
With the current regulation and this new modification, the start of operations at the JK1 and JK2 projects could be
deferred, whose main challenge lies in the delay of the transmission line developed by Grupo de Energia de Bogotá
which will connect AES Colombia's wind projects in La Guajira with the National Interconnected System.
Offshore Wind Generation Roadmap
The government with the support of the World Bank launched the text of the roadmap to promote offshore wind energy
production as it contributes to the development of the energy sector in the medium and long term in Colombia and
provides recommendations on the next steps in terms of policy formulation, planning and development of bankable
projects.
The government is likely to formalize the process of how offshore wind project exploitation zones will be awarded and
the maximum capacities that can be developed in each of these areas are yet to be defined. It is being evaluated
whether the development of this type of resources would require an auction of long-term energy contracts, which could
affect the price formation of the renewable auctions held in 2019 and 2021.
Energy Regulatory Agenda 2023
The Regulatory Agenda defined by the Energy and Gas Regulatory Commission (CREG) for 2023 establishes several
of the issues contemplated in the Roadmap for a Just Energy Transition. The following aspects can be highlighted:
• Review of the regulation of the reliability charge
• Regulation for the development of the hydrogen market.
• New MEM regulations (binding dispatch and intraday market).
• New commercialization models (energy communities, distributed resources).
• Adjustments to the Statute of Risk of Shortages.
• Smart Metering
• Updating of the SIN Networks Code (Operation, Planning and Connection Code).
• Promotion of international connections
ARGENTINA
Update of electricity tariffs of distributors
Within the framework of the Public Hearing held in February 2022, the Ente Nacional Regulador de la Electricidad
(National Electricity Regulatory Entity) applied what was determined by the Energy Secretariat regarding the values
defined for the Energy Price approved by Resolution SE N°105/2022 (average increase of 17%), and on the other
hand, an average adjustment of 41% for transporters and 4% for distributors of national jurisdiction (metropolitan area
of Buenos Aires).
Work continues on the so-called "tariff segmentation" with users divided into groups according to their income level.
Increases due to subsidy reductions and tariff chart updates continue with an 8% increase in the VAD (Distribution
Added Value) approved by the ENRE through Resolution 554/2022 and 555/2022 for EDENOR and EDESUR
distributors. The last tariff increase was in May 2023, through Resolution 398/2022 where the new tariff charts were
published.
Energia Base Regulatory Framework
On April 18, 2022 the Secretariat of Energy modified the pricing scheme of the electric energy commercialized in the
"Energia Base" regulatory framework established by Resolution 440/2021 by means of Resolution 238/2022, effective
43
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
as from the economic transactions of the months of February and June 2022. Additionally, the application of the Usage
Factor that could reduce the capacity payment based on the generation of the last 12 months was eliminated and a
new charge "Remuneration to Exports" related to energy exports from Argentina to Brazil was created.
In December 2022, the Energy Secretariat issued Resolution 826/2022, which updates the prices established in
Resolution 238/2022. This Resolution was retroactively effective as from September 2022 and establishes the
increases to be made in the remuneration of energy in the months of November and December 2022, and February
and August 2023. To date, work continues on updating the price for the months after August 2023.
Resolution 59/2023
On February 7, 2023, the Energy Secretariat published Resolution 59/2023, which allows to dollarize part of the
remuneration of combined cycle plants for a period of up to 5 years, to be paid in Argentine pesos at the official
exchange rate with respect to the U.S. dollar. The new remuneration scheme is voluntary and the agreement has as
counterpart the market administrator CAMMESA, which requires a unit availability commitment of 85%. TermoAndes
agreed to adhere to this new scheme during March 2023. The updated power prices are 2,000 USD + 65% of the
power price set by Resolution 826/22 in winter and summer, and 2,000 U$S + 85% of said prices for spring and
autumn. The price of energy generated with natural gas is set at the equivalent of 3.5 U$S/MWh and with diesel oil at
6.1 US$/MWh.
Energía Plus Regulatory framework
In relation to the Energy Plus Program, created by Resolution SE 1281/2006 and through which Termoandes was
authorized to enter into contracts with Large Users to commercialize energy, a communication was received from
CAMMESA dated July 3, 2020 informing that all contracts entered into under said program would have expired on
October 31, 2020, due to the termination of the 10-year term defined in the original project. However, a subsequent
notification was received from CAMMESA authorizing those contracts initiated on November 1, 2020 and at the same
time allowing to continue entering into contracts on a conditional basis until the Energy Secretariat analyzes the
background context of the Energy Plus Service.
Natural gas commercialization
On December 22, 2022, the Energy Secretariat published Resolution 860/2022, to implement the commercialization
schemes between gas producing companies and CAMMESA or Generators as part of the "Plan for the reinsurance
and enhancement of the federal production of hydrocarbons, internal self-supply, exports, import substitution and
expansion of the transportation system for all hydrocarbon basins of the country 2023-2028" issued by Decree
730/2022.
Resolution 860/2022 establishes the firm volumes of natural gas for the Generation sector represented by CAMMESA
and the Generating Agents. It also establishes the option to adhere to the centralized dispatch which implies the
operational assignment to CAMMESA by the Generators of the product and the contracted transportation capacity, in
addition to incorporating in the dispatch rules a priority order number defined for the Natural Gas according to its origin
in order to minimize the total cost of supply considering the contractual obligations. Additionally, it establishes, for the
Generators with contracts under the Energy Plus Service Program, the option of requesting CAMMESA to supply
natural gas, so that such generation covers their contracts at the cost of supply of each generator.
On January 6, 2023, the Energy Secretariat issued Resolution 6/2023, whereby it updates the terms of Resolution
860/2022 and the tariff charts for consumers of the three groups. Likewise, it establishes a bonus on natural gas prices
for General Service "P" users who are registered or will be registered in the Registry of MSMEs, created by Resolution
No. 220/2019 of the former Secretariat of Entrepreneurs and Small and Medium Enterprises of the former Ministry of
44
Earnings Report - 3Q 23
Production and Labor. Then, by means of Resolution 113/2023, the Energy Secretariat established a bonus in the
natural gas tariff charts for beneficiaries of social programs.
Environmental Regulation
AES Andes, its subsidiaries, and associates are subject to environmental regulations, which, among others, require

On August 17, 2023, Law No. 21,595, the Economic Crimes Law, was published in the Official Gazette, which seeks to
expand the criminal liability of companies, systematize economic and environmental crimes and establish appropriate
penalties. This law introduces amendments to the Criminal Code and to Law No. 20,393 on Criminal Liability of Legal
Entities and seeks to effectively hold individuals and companies that commit crimes in the development of business
activities.

Law N°21,600 creates the Biodiversity and Protected Areas Service
On September 6, 2023, Law No. 21,600 was published in the Official Gazette, creating the Biodiversity and Protected
Areas Service and the National System of Protected Areas. The purpose of this Law is the conservation of biological
diversity and the protection of the country's natural heritage, through the preservation, restoration and sustainable use
of genes, species and ecosystems, with emphasis on those of high environmental value or that, due to their threatened
or degraded condition, require measures for their conservation.
Law No. 21526 amends Law No. 19,300, on General Bases of the Environment, to establish restrictions on the
evaluation of projects in areas declared latent or saturated.
On May 29, 2023, this Law was published, which amends Law 19,300 on the Bases of the Environment, incorporating
the obligation to enter by means of an Environmental Impact Study for projects with significant impact that want to
enter a latent or saturated zone. In addition, the evaluation procedure may be terminated early when a critical impact is
generated.
Critical impact means an alteration to the environment, especially to health and/or environmental components, caused,
directly or indirectly, by a project or activity that cannot be mitigated, repaired or adequately compensated.
Revision of the Noise Emission Standard for Stationary Sources
The Ministry of Environment (MMA), through Resolution No. 1195/2019, initiated the revision of the emission standard
for thermoelectric power plants (DS38/2011 of the MMA).

Earnings Report - 3Q 23
On March 10, 2023, Resolution Ex. 180/23 was issued by the Ministry of the Environment, which approves the
Preliminary Project and submits it to Public Consultation for a period of 60 working days, which was in effect until June
7, 2023, and in which the Company's observations were presented.
Among the most relevant issues for our activities is the incorporation of specific conditions for Wind Farms:
• Requirements for construction work.
• The separation of background noise to correct the background noise to establish the regulatory limit in rural
areas, being different its measurement method,
◦ Concepts such as Acoustic Descriptor, change of Corrected Sound Pressure Level to Equivalent
Sound Pressure Level,
◦ Reduces the influence of occasional or unexpected noise are incorporated.
◦
The concept is maintained that the limits to be met by an emitting source are associated with the location of the
receiver exposed to the noise generated by it and the mechanism to establish the limits considers the existing territorial
planning instrument in the commune, and depending on the combination of land uses allowed in the location of the
receiver, a homologation is generated to one of the zones defined in the Emission Standard. For the homologation it
considers the internalization of the criteria currently established in a resolution of the SMA and incorporates them to the
normative text.
New emission standard for thermoelectric power plants
The Ministry of Environment (MMA), through Resolution No. 130/2020, initiated the revision of the emission standard
for thermoelectric power plants (DS13/2011 of the MMA).
On June 13, 2023, Resolution Ex. 569/23 of the Ministry of the Environment was issued, which approves the
Preliminary Project and submits it to Public Consultation for a period of 60 working days, ending on September 14,
2023.
The preliminary draft proposes a reduction in emission limits for PM, SO2 and NOx for existing sources 5 years after
the standard is published (approximately 2030).
Revision of the Regulation of the Environmental Impact Assessment System.
This Proposal seeks to amend the Regulation of the Environmental Impact Assessment System (RSEIA) established
by D.S. No. 40, of 2012, of the Ministry of the Environment with the objective of:
i. Substantially incorporating the climate change variable in accordance with Article 40 of Law No. 21. 455,
Framework Law on Climate Change.
ii. An improvement in citizen participation in the framework of the environmental impact assessment procedure, in
accordance with the "Regional Agreement on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice
in Environmental Matters in Latin America and the Caribbean", also known as the "Escazú Agreement".
iii. Duly harmonize its provisions with Law No. 20. 920, which Establishes a Framework for Waste Management,
Extended Producer Responsibility and Promotion of Recycling (hereinafter, "REP Law").
Additionally, the impact of the extension of the extraordinary review (25 Quinquies) for the Environmental Impact
Statements (Days) and the extension of the possibility of Citizen Environmental Participation (PACs) for almost all
types of EISs is highlighted. This proposed modification has been approved by the Ministry of the Environment under
Decree No. 30 and has been reviewed by the Comptroller's Office for its legality control.

Tax Regulation
AES Andes, its subsidiaries, and affiliates are subject to existing tax legislation in each country where they operate.
Amendments to laws or modifications in tax rates may have a direct impact on earnings.
CHILE
On February 4, 2022, Law No. 21,420 was enacted, the initial purpose of which is to finance a Universal Guaranteed
Pension (PGU) by increasing the amount and coverage of certain pensions, modifying the tax regulations in several
aspects, among which the following are noteworthy:
– Single tax of 10% on capital gains on instruments with stock market presence (Article 107 of the Income Tax
Law - LIR). The new regulation will tax the higher value obtained in the disposal of instruments and securities
with stock market presence, which until now have been considered as income, with a single tax rate of 10%.
Institutional investors, whether domestic or foreign, will continue to be exempt from taxation. The tax will be
applied to transactions carried out 6 months after the month following the month of publication of the law in the
Official Gazette.
– VAT on the rendering of services as a general rule. The tax will not affect those service providers who issue fee
slips and professional partnerships.
– Repeal of the credit of Article 33 bis of the LIR (investments in fixed assets) for large companies. The
taxpayers of the First Category Tax that during the fiscal year acquire new fixed assets, finished construction or
taken in leasing, are entitled to apply a credit against such tax calculated on 4 to 6% of its value. As from
January 1, 2023, such benefit will be eliminated with respect to taxpayers whose average annual sales in the
last three years exceed UF 100,000.
The Government is currently discussing a "new fiscal pact" through which it wants to retake some initiatives contained
in the bill presented to Congress in July 2022 and which was rejected, but leaving out some of the initiatives that
implied more structural reforms, focusing now on control and powers of the SII, as well as measures that seek to
promote investment and productivity, such as semi-instantaneous depreciation and the transitory reduction of stamp
tax, as well as to encourage the development of new industries such as green hydrogen.

*Rerouted energy or Spot Re-Routing refers to the difference between the customer’s contracted energy and their
actual energy withdrawal. When Angamos has the available generation capacity to cover this differential, the energy is
sold on the spot market, and the margin is passed through to the customer. Rerouted energy is included as a discount
on the monthly invoice to the customers (in contract sales) and is included as income from spot sales.
Angamos generated 715GWh in the third quarter of 2023, up 194GWh from the third quarter of 2022, due to higher
dispatch and higher availability compared to third quarter of 2022 when Angamos Unit 2 was offline for maintenance.
Contract sales revenue for the third quarter was US$54 million, a decrease of 19% or US$13 million, due to lower
coal costs compared to the third quarter of 2022.
Spot energy sales increased by US$11 million, which is explained by an increase in physical sales of 44GWh, higher
capacity revenues, complementary services and other compensations in the spot market.
Fuel Consumption costs decreased 8%, which represented an decrease of US$4 million due to lower coal prices
compared to the same quarter of the previous year, despite the increase in generation.
Energy and Capacity purchase costs decreased due to lower energy purchases from the spot market of 5 GWh in the
third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022.
In relation to Other Cost of Sales there was no significant variation.
On a quarterly basis, Angamos’s Gross Profit increased from US$11 million to US$13 million, while EBITDA increase
from US$13 million to US$15 million. This variation is mainly explained by a higher margin on the sale of energy to
AES Andes as a result of higher sales volume, lower fuel costs and lower energy and power purchases.
The variance in Non-Operating results between the third quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2022 relates to the
US$3 million negative effect from FX differentials which is mainly due to the depreciation of the Chilean peso during the
third quarter of 2023 and its impact on account receivables in in this currency.
Income tax expense decreased by US$1 million, mainly explained by a decrease in income before tax during the third
quarter of 2023.

Rerouted energy or Spot Re-Routing refers to the difference between the customer’s contracted energy and their
actual energy withdrawal. When Cochrane has the available generation capacity to cover this differential, the energy is
sold on the spot market, and the margin is passed through to the customer. Rerouted energy is included as a discount
on the monthly invoice to the customers (in contract sales) and is included as income from spot sales.
Cochrane's generation increased by 163GWh in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The
variation is due to an increase in sales to spot
Revenues decrease US$22 million compared to the same period of the previous year, mainly explained by a decrease
in revenues from energy sales of non-regulated contracts of US$25 million due to lower energy sales volumes of
16GWh partially offset by higher prices of fixed charges of contracts denominated in US$ and indexed for US inflation.
This effect was partially offset by an increase in spot market sales of US$2 million due to higher energy sales volumes
of 135GWh.
Transmission revenues slightly decreased by 17% respect the same period in 2022, mainly associated with lower
customer withdrawals.
Costs of sales decreased US$25 million which is mainly explained by a reduction in fuel consumption costs of US$25
million, due to lower average coal prices, offset by higher physical consumption associated with a higher generation of
163 GWh.
On a quarterly basis, Cochrane’s Gross Profit reached US$39 million, a 9% increase from the third quarter of 2022,
while EBITDA registered in the third quarter of 2023 was US$53 million, 7% up than the same period last year. The
main reason behind these variations is due to the fixed charge associated with Cochrane's contract.
Non-Operating results for the third quarter of 2023 totaled a negative US$17 million a variation of 25% compares to the
US$14 million loss registered in the same period in 2022. This variation is mainly due to the negative variation of the
foreign currency exchange differences. The foreign currency exchange differences recorded a negative variation of
US$5 million in the third quarter of 2023 respect the same period of 2022, primarily due to the impact of the a
depreciation of the Chilean peso in the quarter against the U.S. dollar on the company's local currency asset position
for the period ended September 2023.
Net income for the period ended September 2023 was US$15 million, there was no significant variation with respect to
the compared to 15 million for September 30, 2022.
Total debt for Cochrane as of September 30, 2023 was US$743 million and is comprised of (i) a local bond
denominated in USD with a face value of US$485 million maturing in 2034, and (ii) a 144/A guaranteed bond
denominated in USD for US$258 million, maturing in 2027.
Cash and cash equivalent at the end of September 30, 2023 was US$125 million, a US$109 increase compared to
US$16 million on September 30, 2022.
