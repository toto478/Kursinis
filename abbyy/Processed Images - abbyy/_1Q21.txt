Ethane Supply
During 1Q21, the total ethane supply was 43.3 kbpd, representing 66% of Braskem Idesa’s total
ethane requirements, which was an increase of 23% compared to the last quarter and a 22%
decrease compared to 1Q20.
• National Ethane – During 1Q21, the average supply from PEMEX was 30.1 kbpd a reduction
of 43% compared to 1Q20. This reduction was due to the floods in PEMEX’s oil production
fields in Tabasco in 4Q20, which subsequently reduced ethane output. Compared to 4Q20,
supply increased 7%, despite the lack of supply in December.
• Imported Ethane – The Fast-Track solution supplied 13.16 kbpd of ethane, representing 20%
of the total supply needs. With this supply rate, the Fast-Track solution doubled the average
amount supplied during 2020, which stood at 6.4 kbpd. Furthermore, compared with 4Q20
and 1Q20, the supply of imported ethane increased by 6.1 kbpd and 10.7 kbpd, respectively,
resulting from the expansion of the Fast-Track solution, achieving 17.4 kbpd in a single
month, with peaks of 24 kbpd of supply in a single day.
Braskem Idesa Earnings Release 1Q21
PE Demand
In 1Q21, North American demand increased 0.5% compared to 1Q20, due to the strong economic
recovery and a sustained increase in demand for packaging products. However, in February, the
North American market supply was impacted by Winter Storm Uri, on the Texas Gulf Coast,
impacting North American producers' operations, which caused logistic constraints for the whole
petrochemical industry.
Despite the healthy demand for PE products, the demand in Mexico dropped in 1Q20 (-4%) due in
good part to the low availability of products in the market from Braskem Idesa and other players,
limiting purchases in the period.
Average Utilization Rate of PE Plants
Utilization rates in 1Q21 increased by 10p.p. compared with 4Q20, while there was a 38p.p.
decrease compared to 1Q20. Production reached 150 kt during the period compared to 126 kt in
4Q20 and 224kt in 1Q20, respectively, with the complex operating far below capacity due to the
required adaptation in the production process following natural gas constraints.
Sales Volume
Total sales during 1Q21 decreased 26% compared with 4Q20 and 36% compared with 1Q20,
respectively. Given the lack of production in December and the need to recover inventory levels,
sales during 1Q21 were negatively impacted. The prioritization of the domestic market remained in
place to attend to BI's local clients, which reached 68% of the total sales during the quarter.
Braskem Idesa Earnings Release 1Q21
Sales to the export market represented 32% of total sales, with a significant reduction in low-
profitability markets, such as Overseas, while maintaining sales to our key customers in the other
regions.

same period of 2020. BI's post-consumer resin (PCR) reached 1.8 kton, representing close to half of
all the total sales of PCR during 2020.
OPERATING RESULTS
Operating results in 1Q21 were positively influenced by higher spreads in the period, despite lower
sales volume.

EBITDA
EBITDA in 1Q21 reached US$ 100MM, representing a 45% and 38% increase compared to 4Q20 and
1Q20. Meanwhile, the Operating EBITDA margin increased by 14p.p and 8p.p compared with 4Q20
and 1Q20, respectively, favored by higher petrochemical spreads during the period despite
unfavorable operating conditions.
Revenues
Net revenues increased by 3% and 16% compared to 4Q20 and 1Q20, respectively, due to favorable
market conditions reflected in higher PE international reference prices.
COGS
Total COGS decreased compared to 4Q20 due to lower sales volume during the period, despite
resumption of operations with the adapted production process. Additionally, during 4Q20, total
COGS rose due the cost of idle capacity associated with this extraordinary event.

Braskem Idesa Earnings Release 1Q21
Financial Expenses
The decrease in 1Q21 compared to 4Q20, can be explained by the impact of the depreciation of the
Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar. Interest expenses were US$ 60 MM. Compared with 1Q20,
there was a decrease in interest expenses associated with the impact of the appreciation of
the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.
Financial Income
Financial Income increased in 1Q21 compared to 4Q20 and decreased compared to 1Q20. This can
be explained in part by volatility in the long-term derivative instruments related to the interest rate
swap operation associated with the Project Finance debt.
Net Exchange Variation
Net Exchange Variation decreased in 1Q21 compared to 4Q20. This was caused by the depreciation
of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar on the outstanding balance of Braskem Idesa’s loan for
US$2.359 billion. Regarding 1Q20, the variation is related to the appreciation of the Mexican peso
against the U.S. dollar on the outstanding balance of Braskem Idesa’s loan.

Free Cash Flow Generation
The decrease in free cash flow compared with 4Q20 is associated with negative Working Capital
change, mainly due to the increase in accounts receivable and recovery of inventory levels. In
relation to 1Q20, the cash flow increase is explained by higher EBITDA generation driven by
increased PE reference prices during 1Q21.
