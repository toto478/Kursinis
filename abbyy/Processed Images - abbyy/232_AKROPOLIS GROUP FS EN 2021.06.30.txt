FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED 30 JUNE 2021
All tabular amounts are in EUR thousand unless otherwise stated
NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1. GENERAL INFORMATION
Akropolis Group, UAB (entity code 302533135) (hereafter – “the Company”) was incorporated on 30 July 2011 in
Lithuania as a limited liability company under the Companies Law of Lithuania. Its registered office is Ozo St. 25, Vilnius,
Lithuania.
The sole shareholder of the Company, owning 100% of shares, was UAB “Vilniaus Prekyba”, company code 302608755,
address Ozo str. 25, Vilnius. The ultimate parent entity is Metodika B.V., address: Amstelveenseweg 500, 1081 KL,
Amsterdam, Kingdom of the Netherlands, operating in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The ultimate controlling party is
Mr. Nerijus Numa.
The consolidated group is comprised of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (hereafter collectively referred as
“the Group”). The Group has undergone a change in corporate structure whereby Akropolis Real Estate B.V. and all of
its subsidiaries became subsidiaries of Akropolis Group, UAB (the “Reorganisation”). On 22 March 2021, UAB “Vilniaus
Prekyba”, the sole shareholder of Akropolis Group, UAB and Akropolis Real Estate B.V., adopted a decision to increase
the share capital of Akropolis Group, UAB by non-monetary contribution of the shareholder, namely, the payment of the
subscription price of the newly issued shares in Akropolis Group, UAB has been performed by transferring ownership of
100% of the shares in Akropolis Real Estate B.V. from UAB “Vilniaus Prekyba” to Akropolis Group, UAB. Shares in
Akropolis Real Estate B.V. were transferred to the ownership of Akropolis Group, UAB by notarial deed on 24 March
2021. All formal registrations finalizing the Reorganisation were completed on 6 April 2021.
Last available financial statements were combined financial statements of Akropolis Group, UAB and Akropolis Real
Estate B.V. for the years ended 2020 and 2019. The combined financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts
of either of the two companies. IFRS does not prescribe how to prepare combined financial statements, however, the
Conceptual Framework to IFRS envisages that the reporting entity might comprise two or more entities that are not all
linked by a parent-subsidiary relationship. In this case the reporting entity’s financial statements are referred to as
‘combined financial statements’.
The Reorganisation, completed on 6 April 2021, is a business combination under common control. The accounting for
common control transactions is not prescribed by IFRS. One of the acceptable methods to account for such transactions,
which is now used by Akropolis Group, UAB, is to apply the predecessor values method (the historical carrying values
from the combining businesses) in the interim consolidated financial statements of Akropolis Group, UAB for the six
months ended 30 June 2021, with the retrospective presentation approach. Under this approach, the interim
consolidated financial statements of Akropolis Group, UAB is presented as if the businesses have been combined from
the beginning of the earliest period presented because Akropolis Group, UAB and Akropolis Real Estate B.V. were under
common control as of that date.
As of 31 December 2020 share capital of Akropolis Group UAB and Akropolis Real Estate B.V. combined financial
statements consisted of EUR 43 thousand of the share capital of Akropolis Group UAB and of EUR 140,110 thousand
of the share capital of Akropolis Real Estate B.V. On 22 March 2021 the Shareholder's decision was signed to increase
the share capital of Akropolis Group UAB from EUR 43 thousand to EUR 31,737 thousand with a non-monetary
Shareholder's contribution - Akropolis Real Estate B.V. 100% stake. In connection therewith, Akropolis Group UAB has
issued 109,291 thousand new ordinary registered shares of EUR 0.29 par value each (hereinafter, the "Newly Issued
Shares"). The total issue price of all Newly Issued Shares - EUR 479,790 thousand. The balances of the previous year,
which have been recalculated retrospectively by assessing the Group's share capital, share premium and retained
earnings, differ from Combined Financial Statements of the Group for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 31
December 2019 due to transition from combined to consolidated financial statements. On April 29, 2020, the decision of
the shareholder reduced Akropolis Real Estate B.V. authorized capital by 132 100 thousand EUR. In the Combined
financial statements for the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2019 this was shown as a reduction of authorized
capital. In these interim condensed consolidated financial statements 132 100 thousand EUR shown as a decrease in
the share premium because these financial statements are presented as if the businesses have been combined from
the beginning of the earliest period.
The Group’s key area of operations includes the development of real estate owned by the Group and its lease to tenants
based on agreements.
The Group’s bonds are traded at Euronext Dublin (Ireland) and Nasdaq Vilnius (Lithuania) stock exchanges.
The Company’s management authorized these interim condensed consolidated financial statements on 27th September
2021.

 Level 2 — valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement
is directly or indirectly observable;

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Group is currently involved in legal proceedings (two cases) related to the 2005-11-04 acquisition by Vingio Turtas,
UAB of state-owned land that is the site of Akropolis Vingis. The validity of part of the state-owned land sale and purchase
agreement (Agreement) is challenged due to an alleged breach of the claimants’ rights of property restitution.
The National Land Service has adopted decisions favourable to Vingio Turtas, UAB. These decisions are currently being
challenged in first instance administrative proceedings. The first instance civil case directly challenging the validity of
part of the Agreement is suspended pending a decision in the administrative proceedings.
The Group does not agree with the claimants’ case and considers the possibility of satisfaction of the claims as low.
The legal proceedings do not affect the Group's rights over the Vingis site and development of Akropolis Vingis. In the
event that the claimants were to prove successful, the Vingis site could be materially reduced in size, however,
implementation of any potential award would be a highly complicated legal issue.

Furthermore, below is the timeline of the most significant restriction periods, which affected the Group during first half of

 December 21, 2020 - May 16, 2021: Partial close down - only the shops selling first necessity goods were

Since December, 2020 Lithuanian and Latvian governments have started immunising the population against Covid-19.
At the date of the release of these financial statements, more than 60% of Lithuanian and more than 45% of Latvian
population has been vaccinated at least once. In order to accelerate vaccination process, both countries have enforced
additional limitations and/or quarantine like measures for non-vaccinated citizens. Lithuanian government has passed a
ruling to limit certain economic activities of citizens without a valid Covid-19 certificate as of September 13, 2021.
Included in those limitations is a prohibition to enter large shopping centres, beauty salons, restaurants and
entertainment facilities.
Despite ongoing global pandemic, the Group managed to increase the collection rate during the first half of 2021 to 98%.
Thus, management believes that liquidity position of the Group is sufficient and proven track record indicates strong
resilience and flexibility to subside the negative effects of coronavirus pandemic.
