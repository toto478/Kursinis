CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Globalworth’s strong momentum at the end of 2017, led by its strategic expansion into Poland, was maintained in the first half of
2018. The Group has continued to expand its portfolio, improving its operations and further strengthening its balance sheet; all
consistent with our goal of being the leading office landlord in Central and Eastern Europe, with a dominant presence in two of the
most significant markets in the region, Romania and Poland.
In the first half of the year we invested €276.2 million in new acquisitions, mainly in Poland, our development programme in Romania,
and our renovation and maintenance programme. With the addition of the high-rise Spektrum Tower office in Warsaw in July-18, we
are proud to have been able to complete two of the five largest office transactions in the Polish market so far this year, resulting in
our overall combined portfolio exceeding €2.2 billion and positioning us as the largest institutional office landlord in Poland. Given our
market leading position in Romania, we have now become the largest institutional office landlord in the broader CEE region.
We are delighted to have established a collaboration with Mindspace Ltd., the leading global operator of high-end, inspiring coworking
space. As part of this collaboration, Globalworth has made an equity investment in Mindspace of US$10 million (c.€8.6 million) to
support its ongoing growth, and Mindspace will establish operations in three locations in Bucharest, in addition to its existing location
with Globalworth in Warsaw.
Our two countries of focus continue to enjoy economic growth ahead of the wider European region and are forecast to continue to do
so over the coming years. This strong economic backdrop is supportive for the real estate markets, which continue to evolve and
institutionalise. Vacancy rates in our submarkets fell during the first half of the year, putting upward pressure on both headline and
net effective rents. The established regional cities in Poland continue to develop steadily and, in addition, certain regional cities in
Romania have started to emerge with healthy investor and tenant demand for good quality schemes. We remain confident that the
market will continue to grow and have been encouraged by rising investor appetite. As a result of this and with the support of continued
economic expansion, we believe that property yields, which remain higher than those of more mature real estate markets, will continue
to contract.
Our portfolio performance continues to be strong, with average occupancy remaining at a high level at 94.6% following an underlying
improvement in like-for-like occupancy of 2.1% over the first six months of the year to 95.2% (as at 30 June 2018), while our
annualised contracted rents increased by 21.7% during the first half of the year to €141.1 million as at 30 June 2018.
Our financial results for the first half of 2018 benefited from the full effect of consolidation of the GPRE acquisition completed in
December 2017, resulting in total revenue generated more than doubling compared to the same period last year to reach €78.1
million. Normalised EBITDA and EPRA Earnings both increased by 2.1x and 4.0x to €38.7 million and €28.4 million respectively.
Globalworth continues to be active in the capital markets. In March 2018 we issued €550m in senior unsecured notes with 7-year
maturity and a coupon of 3.0% in an offering that was more than two times oversubscribed. We are proud that Fitch assigned us an
investment grade rating of BBB-, while Moody’s upgraded our rating to Ba1 (from Ba2). In addition, Globalworth Poland completed
a €450 million equity capital raise supporting its continued portfolio expansion, comprising €300 million from Globalworth and €150
million of new equity capital from our largest shareholder Growthpoint Properties. We consider our balance sheet to be strongly
positioned, with Net LTV remaining at a conservative level at 36.2% (34.3% in December 2017).
EPRA NAV rose by 2.5% to €1.2 billion, or €9.06 per share (€8.84 at 31 December 2017). This follows the payment of a dividend of
€0.22 per share in January 2018 relating to the second half of 2017. Post the period end, in August 2018 our shareholders received
an interim dividend in respect of the first half of 2018 of €0.27 per share, with a second interim dividend expected to be paid in January
2019, resulting in an aggregate dividend for the financial year 2018 of not less than €0.54 per share, as previously announced.
Our continuous growth and success over the years could not have been achieved without our team of professionals in Romania and
Poland. I would once again like to thank them for their dedication, expertise and enthusiasm. Our combined team has now grown to
over 170 professionals and this number will increase further to support our business needs into the future.
Finally, as part of its strategic initiatives in the Polish market, Globalworth took steps to further strengthen its collaboration with GPRE.
This included rebranding GPRE as Globalworth Poland and the appointment of Mr Norbert Sasse, CEO of Growthpoint Properties,
and Mr George Muchanya, Growthpoint's Head of Corporate Strategy to the Board of Directors of Globalworth Poland, in addition to
being board members of Globalworth. I would like to wish my fellow board members every success in their new roles.
Our priorities for the remainder of 2018 are to expand our footprint through value-enhancing acquisitions and developments and to
further improve our occupancy rate and enhance our tenant experience and satisfaction, while maintaining capital discipline and a
prudent capital structure as we seek to maximise returns for our shareholders. We continue to strengthen our in-house asset
management capabilities and improve the operational efficiencies between our operations in Romania and Poland. In addition, we
continue to prepare for our planned move to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. As always, the team at Globalworth
remains busy and committed to driving the business forward.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
Through our investments in Romania and Poland we have set ourselves the goal of being the leading office investor and landlord
in Central and Eastern Europe and the partner of choice for the wide variety of high-quality tenants active or seeking to become
established in the region.
Essential to achieving this goal is creating a portfolio of high quality properties, in prime locations within their respective sub-
markets, which will allow Globalworth to target attractive, risk-adjusted returns through sustainable recurring rents and capital
growth. As part of our strategy we have invested, and will continue to invest, in a combination of standing properties and
development opportunities, which are then actively managed by our team of professionals.
INVESTMENT ACTIVITY
• Total combined portfolio value exceeded the €2 billion threshold for the first time in our history, reaching €2.1 billion (95%
in standing properties) as of 30 June 2018
• Acquired six new investments for a total of €247.3 million and delivered Globalworth Campus Tower 2 in the first half of the
year
• Acquired one additional property in Poland for €101.0 million in July-18
Globalworth’s real estate portfolio continued to grow in the first half of 2018, with the Company maintaining its strong momentum
through new acquisitions mainly in Poland and further progress in its development programme in Romania.
As at 30 June 2018, Globalworth’s combined portfolio comprised 35 investments in Romania and Poland with an appraised value
of €2.1 billion, representing an increase of 17.3% compared to 31 December 2017.
Our main focus is to invest in office properties (standing or developments), which are subsequently actively managed by the Group.
Such properties account for 73.9% of our appraised value, followed by the three high-street mixed-use (office and retail) properties
in Poland, owned through Globalworth Poland and which account for 14.9%. The remainder of our combined portfolio comprises
light-industrial / logistics properties, a residential complex which is partially owned, and land for future development in Bucharest
and Timisoara (Romania).
Our real estate portfolio in Poland grew in the first half of the year mainly through the addition of three new standing investments,
which resulted in the value of our Polish properties reaching €932.4 million as at 30 June 2018, accounting for 43.8% (37.5% at
31 December 2017) of our combined portfolio value.
Bucharest and Warsaw account for 51.0% and 11.5% respectively of our combined portfolio, with the remainder of our properties
located in seven regional cities in Romania and Poland.
The greatest concentration by value remains in the new Central Business District (CBD) of Bucharest (Romania) where we have
10 investments with 11 standing properties and one office tower under development, accounting as of 30 June 2018 for 39.3% of
the combined portfolio value and made up of 287.9k sqm of standing commercial GLA and 309 residential units. In Warsaw, our
six standing investments, offering 82.7k of commercial GLA, are spread around the city and occupy prime locations within their
respective sub-markets.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
New Investments
In the first half of 2018, Globalworth made six new investments in Poland and Romania for a total of €247.3 million.
The most significant transaction was the acquisition in Poland of a high-quality office complex of five buildings known as Quattro
Business Park (“QBP”) for a total consideration of €139.0 million. The property is located in the northern part of Krakow, c.5.0km
from the city centre and close to the city ring road. QBP was completed in phases between 2010 and 2015 and offers in total 60.3k
sqm of GLA and 1,335 parking spaces. The property is multi-tenanted to c.50 national and multinational corporates, with
Capgemini, Google and Luxoft being the largest occupiers. The park is almost fully occupied (99.0% occupancy), with annual
contracted rental income of €10.7 million and a weighted average lease length of 3.1 years as at 30 June 2018.We are excited to
have acquired the well recognisable office tower known as “Warta Tower” in Warsaw, Poland in which we have identified some
interesting asset management angles. The property is located at the extended West Central Business District of Warsaw and was
acquired for a total consideration of €55.0 million. Warta Tower was completed in 2000 and offers 33.7k sqm (post re-measurement
of areas) of GLA and 542 parking spaces over 21 floors above ground and three underground levels. Its distinct features include
its dark blue glazed glass and its iconic lobby with a sculpture by Barbara Falender. The property is multi-tenanted and has a high
occupancy rate (91.3%), with TUiR Warta S.A. (insurance company, subsidiary of Talanx International AG) as its largest tenant. It
has an annual contracted rental income of €5.9 million and a weighted average lease length of 2.9 years as at 30 June 18. Whilst,
the property is already offering a very attractive current income, we are currently assessing longer-term repositioning alternatives,
which are consistent with the Group’s active asset management approach.
The third transaction completed in Poland during the first half of 2018 involved the acquisition of the class “A” office property known
as “West Link”, completed in 2018, for a total consideration of €35.8 million. West Link is located to the west of the city centre of
Wroclaw and is well situated within the city’s key communication arteries. It offers 14.4k sqm of GLA and 265 parking spaces over
six floors above ground and two underground levels. It is fully let, with an annual contracted rental income of €2.5 million, and had
a weighted average lease length of 6.7 years as at 30 June 2018. The main tenant is Nokia Solutions & Network, which is also
the main tenant at Globalworth Poland’s West Gate, an adjacent high-quality office property which offers a further 16.6k sqm of
class “A” office space.
In Romania, where the Group is looking to its next phase of development projects, as previously announced Globalworth completed
the acquisition of the two land plots in the new CBD of Bucharest for a total consideration of €15.5 million. The first land plot is
located between the Globalworth Plaza and the Green Court "B" offices owned by the Company and represents the last remaining
street-facing land plot on Gara Herastrau street. The second land plot is adjacent to Globalworth’s Green Court complex and will
be used to further expand the complex. The combined lands are anticipated to allow for the development of c.40.0k sqm of
commercial (predominantly office) space. A third plot of land was acquired in June 2018 for €2.0 million, directly adjacent to the
RBC project in the West of Bucharest, with the potential for building a new c.60k sqm GLA property offering predominantly class
“A” office space and, thereby, creating a campus of over 100k sqm of GLA at this location.
New Deliveries
Globalworth continued with its active development/construction programme and in Q2-18 delivered the second tower of the
Globalworth Campus project in Bucharest. This is the seventh property delivered by Globalworth in Romania since the beginning
of 2015, increasing the total GLA developed by the Company to c.200.0k sqm.
In April 2018, Globalworth Campus Tower 2 opened for business with 28.2k sqm of GLA and 180 parking spaces, extending over
12 floors above ground and two underground levels. The delivery of Tower 2 marks the completion of Phase A of the Globalworth
Campus project, which comprises two class “A” office towers with total GLA of 57.2k sqm and 456 parking spaces.
Renovation and Maintenance Programme of Standing Properties
Globalworth’s ongoing efforts to offer best-in-class real estate space to its business partners continued in 2018, with further
implementation of its renovation and maintenance programme at selected properties in the portfolio. In the first half of the year, we
carried out improvement works predominantly on six of our standing properties in our portfolio, with minor works performed on a
number of others.
In total, €2.0 million was invested under our renovation and maintenance programme with works involving primarily the upgrade of
both indoor and outdoor common areas. The purpose of such investments goes beyond simply maintaining our portfolio as it seeks
to preserve and enhance the value of our modern, high quality portfolio well into the future, in-line with our long-term approach.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
H2-2018 Investments
In July 2018, Globalworth completed the acquisition of the class “A” office known as Spektrum Tower for a total consideration of
€101.0 million. Spektrum Tower is a high-rise office building in the heart of the Warsaw’s Central Business District, offering 29.5k
sqm of GLA and 318 parking spaces over 33 floors above ground and five underground levels. It was completed in 2003 and
underwent extensive refurbishment in 2015, when it was converted into a multi-tenanted building. The property benefits from high
occupancy (92.5%), which we are confident can be increased in the near-term. Spektrum is leased to over 60 national and
international corporates and is thus well suited to our asset management-led approach. It has an annual contracted rental income
of c.€6.3 million and a weighted average lease length of 5.1 years, as at 30 June 18.
LEASING UPDATE
• Total contracted rent reached €141.1million (98.9% commercial properties) as of 30 June 2018
• 60.5k sqm of commercial space leased in Romania and Poland during this period at an average WALL of 8.6 years
• 879.3k sqm of commercial GLA with a remaining average WALL of 5.4years (30 June 2018)
• Occupancy rate of our standing portfolio reached 94.6% (96.4% incl. tenant options) (30 June 2018)
Globalworth’s leasing momentum remained strong in the first half of 2018. Market conditions continue to be positive, with
Globalworth benefiting from healthy demand for high quality office space in its target real estate markets.
During H1-18, through its proactive internal leasing capabilities, the Group successfully negotiated the take-up (incl. expansions)
or extension of 60.5k sqm of commercial space in Romania and Poland, with an average WALL of 8.6 years. New leases,
representing 41.8k sqm, were signed at a WALL of 9.8 years and included tenants such as Mindspace, Dell, Honeywell, Calypso,
Delphi, Vodafone and 29 other corporates. Leases were renewed, and thus extended for 22 of our tenants for a total of 14.4k sqm
of GLA, at a WALL of 6.1 years, with the most notable extensions involving Eurozet, World Calls, Baxter and CITR. The remaining
space 4.3k sqm signed in the period involved the expansion of six existing tenants at an average WALL of 6.1 years.

Occupancy of our standing commercial portfolio as of 30 June 18 was 94.6%, representing a 1.5% increase over H1-2018 (93.3%
as of 31 December 2017). On a like-for-like basis, occupancy increased by 2.1% to 95.2% following the successful lease-up of
previously vacant space. The overall vacancy level was modestly weighed down by several of the new additions to the standing
portfolio during the period where current occupancy rates were lower, but where the Company is confident there is near-term scope
for further upside in occupancy and contracted rents.
In total we have 879.3k sqm of commercial GLA leased to approximately 510 tenants, at an average WALL of 5.4 years, the
majority of which is let to national and multinational corporates which are well-known within their respective markets.

The Group is pleased that the lease-up of Globalworth Campus is progressing well, with new leases with Dell (6.7k sqm), Honeywell
(5.7k sqm), Mindspace (4.5k sqm), Delphi (2.2k sqm) and others signed in 2018. Occupancy in Tower 1 stood at 84.9% (96.2%
including tenant options) as at 30 June 2018, compared to 46.8% (73.6% including tenant options) as at 31 December 2017. Tower
2 was 70.8% let at 30 June 2018 (90.1% including tenant options), compared to 28.0% as at 31 December 2017. Occupancy in
Towers 1 and 2 has further increased during H2-2018 reaching 88.4% (100.0% including tenant options) and 71.9% (91.5%
including tenant options) respectively.
Other notable changes in occupancy were achieved at City Offices and Gara Herastrau in Bucharest, where occupancy improved
in the first half of the year by 38.7% and 11.9%, reaching 68.5% (75.3% including tenant options) and 84.0% (92.9% including
tenant options) respectively as at 30 June 2018.
At TCI, occupancy temporarily decreased as a result of the space returned by the Ministry of European Funds at the beginning of
the year. Part of the space vacated was quickly taken up by EY and Mindspace, however, resulting in this popular building being
effectively fully occupied as at 30 June 2018.
Like-for-like occupancy in our standing Romanian portfolio was 94.1% at 30 June 18, increasing by 3.7% from 90.8% at 31
December 2017. The addition of Globalworth Campus Tower 2, which was delivered during the year and is in its lease-up stage,
resulted in the overall occupancy rate of our standing portfolio increasing by 2.3% in the first half of the year to 92.9% (95.8% incl.
tenant options) (30 June 2018).
Poland
In Poland, like-for-like occupancy was 97.6% as at 30 June 18, decreasing from 98.5% at the 31 December 2017. In addition, the
acquisition of the Warta Tower (91.3% occupancy), Quattro Business Park (99.0% occupancy) and West Link (100.0% occupancy)
offices, resulted in the overall occupancy rate of our Polish portfolio at 97.3% as of 30 June 2018.
In the first six months of 2018, 21 new contracts were signed in seven of our buildings for a total of 10.1k sqm, with the most
notable additions being Calypso (3.5k sqm in Renoma and Supersam), Baxter (1.2k sqm in Nordic Park), City Space (1.1k sqm in
Tryton and Supersam). Groupon (1.1k sqm in Supersam) and Mindspace (0.7k sqm in Hala Koszyki). An additional 7.2k sqm of
GLA were renewed in our portfolio, the majority of which were associated with the extension of the Eurozet lease (4.0k sqm) in the
Bliski property in Warsaw, and the Baxter lease (2.5k sqm, including an expansion of 1.2k sqm mentioned above) in Nordic Park.
The positive results of our leasing efforts are improving the risk-profile of our portfolio and are reducing our exposure to Master
Leases provided by the vendors from which the portfolio was acquired (€2.3 million on 30 June 2018 vs. €3.5 million on 31
December 2017, on an annualised basis).

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
CAPITAL MARKETS UPDATE
• Successfully issued €550 million of senior unsecured notes in March 18, with a 7-year maturity and a coupon of 3.0%
which was more than two times oversubscribed
• Received investment grade rating from Fitch (BBB-), while Moody’s upgraded our credit rating to Ba1 (from Ba2)
• Completed a €450 million equity capital raise in June 18 at Globalworth Poland
• Net LTV maintained within targeted levels reaching 36.2% (30 June 2018)
Efficiently managing our equity and debt financing is pivotal to achieving a balance that allows for the sustainable growth of the
Company, enhances medium-term shareholder returns, and controls the inherent risk associated with third-party debt.
Two sizeable capital market transactions were completed during the first half of 2018; a €550 million debt issuance by Globalworth
and a €450 million equity issuance by Globalworth Poland, which provided additional capital to support the Group’s growth and
ongoing investment activities. More information on this is contained within the Financial Review.
During H1-18, Moody’s and S&P published updates on our credit rating, with Moody’s upgrading our rating from Ba1 (from Ba2)
and S&P affirming its BB+ rating, while revising the outlook to positive from stable. In addition, Fitch initiated its coverage with an
investment grade rating of BBB-. Ongoing positive traction with both debt and equity investors is important to our business, and
we continue to widen engagement in this area. We maintain an active investor relations program through participation in industry
conferences, hosting site visits and individual investor meetings.
During the period, the Company has undertaken preparatory work as it seeks to move to a Premium Listing on the London Stock
Exchange’s Main Market. While much progress has been made, the Board has concluded it is optimal to wait until the end of the
2018 financial year before taking this step and, subject to meeting all the necessary regulatory requirements, now envisages that
this listing will take place in H1-2019. The Company will continue to update investors on this initiative, alongside its ongoing
objective to generate interest from new institutional investors and increasing the liquidity of its shares.
INVESTMENT IN COWORKING AND PARTNERSHIP WITH MINDSPACE
• Strategic partnership with Mindspace, one of the leading operators of high-end coworking spaces
• 10.8k sqm taken up in three locations in Bucharest on long-term contracts
• US$10 million equity investment by Globalworth in Mindspace to facility further growth
In June 2018 Globalworth announced its collaboration with Mindspace Ltd., the leading global operator of high-end, inspiring
coworking space.
As part of this collaboration:
• Mindspace will open its first locations in Romania in three of our buildings, taking-up 10.8k sqm of GLA in total on a long-term
basis. The three locations chosen were branded by the tenant to its perspective partners as Mindspace Business District
(Globalworth Campus), Mindspace City Offices (City Offices) and Mindspace Victoriei (TCI). Romania marks the seventh
country in which Mindspace offers its flexible workplace solutions.
• Globalworth made an equity investment in Mindspace of US$10 million (c.€8.6 million) to support its ongoing growth
As background to this transaction, Globalworth was already familiar with the activities and approach of Mindspace given the space
that it occupies at our flagship Hala Koszyki property in Warsaw.
We have also been firm believers of the benefit of the co-working concept and of the approach offered by Mindspace, as it enables
us to cater to a wider universe of potential tenants and their ever-changing needs. In our view, Mindspace offers best in class flex-
office solutions that are well aligned with the quality and level of service that Globalworth wishes to offer its partners, and we are
delighted to be able to assist in their future growth.
ENHANCING THE GLOBALWORTH IDENTITY AND REINFORCING OUR IN-HOUSE TEAM OF PROFESSIONALS
• Rebranding of GPRE to Globalworth Poland to enhance Globalworth’s corporate identity
• Over 170 professionals at Group level
As part of its strategic initiatives in the Polish market, Globalworth has enhanced its corporate identity and further strengthened
the integration of GPRE, most notably through the rebranding of its Polish subsidiary to Globalworth Poland.

MANAGEMENT REVIEW
As part of our continuous effort to offer premium services to our tenants, efficiently manage our high-quality portfolio, and facilitate

with owners, occupiers, property specialists and community representatives, as well as domestic and international investors and
capital providers.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
A. Highlights
• Net operating income (“NOI”) of €51.7 million (H1-17: €22.0 million), an increase of 135% over H1-17 mainly as a result of the
significant increase in the number of revenue yielding assets of the Group following the expansion into the Polish market at the
end of December 2017, as well as new lease agreements signed during 2017 in Romania.
• Normalised EBITDA1 from ongoing operating activities of €38.7 million (H1-17: €18.8 million), an increase of 106% over H1-17
due to the growth in NOI.
• EPRA Earnings of €28.4 million (H1-17: €7.1 million), an increase of 300% over H1-17 indicating a significant increase in the
results from the Group’s operating activities.
• Earnings before tax of €64.0 million, compared to a €6.8 million loss in H1-17. This significant improvement reflects the growth
in net operating income, a reduction of the one-off bank loan break costs, and debt issue cost amortisation resulting from debt
refinancing activities that impacted H1-17 (H1-18: €0.9 million, H1-17: €16.1 million). H1-18 also benefited from a €38.6 million
fair value gain on investment property (H1-17: €0.7 million).
• Portfolio Open Market Value ("OMV") of €2,129.5 million2 (31 December 2017: €1,815.4 million), up 17.3% compared to 31
December 2017 primarily due to acquisitions, development expenditure and appraised fair value gains.
• Net Loan to Value of 36.2% (31 December 2017: 34.3%), up 1.9 per cent compared to 31 December 2017.
• Gross Loan to Value of 60.7% (31 December 2017: 49.5%), up 11.2 per cent compared to 31 December 2017 as a result of the
issuance of the 7 year €550 million Eurobond in March 2018.
• EPRA NAV of €1,200.6 million (31 December 2017: €1,171.5 million) and EPRA NAV per share3 of €9.06 (31 December 2017:
€8.84), both up 2.5% compared to 31 December 2017. The level of increase was impacted by the interim dividend distribution
declared in January 2018 (€0.22 per share in respect of H2-17), the bank loan break costs, and the full amortisation of debt
issue costs in Poland. Including the H2-17 dividend distribution, the increase in ERPA NAV would be 5.0% for the six-month
period to 30 June 2018. Compared to 30 June 2017, the EPRA NAV per share at 30 June 2018 of €9.06 (30 June 2017: €8.30)
rose 9.2%, or 11.8% including the H2-17 dividend.

Interim Report and Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 30 June 2018 11
FINANCIAL REVIEW
B. Analysis of results for the six months period ended 30 June 2018 (continued)
• Revenues and NOI increased during H1-18 by 124% and 135% respectively over H1-17 and by 82% and 78% compared to H2-
17. This was mainly as a result of the Group’s expansion in Poland in December 2017, the acquisition of three additional income
yielding investments in Poland during the first six months of 2018, the acquisition of two fully leased properties in Romania in
May 2017 and August 2017 respectively, and new leases signed for our standing properties in Romania.
• Revenues derived from our properties and operations in Romania and Poland accounted for 55% and 45% of the total for the
Globalworth Group for H1-18 respectively, while NOI derived from our operations in Romania and Poland accounted for 52%
and 48% of the total for the Globalworth Group for H1-18.
• Administrative expenses in H1-18 doubled as compared to H1-17 mainly due to the inclusion of administrative expenses incurred
by Globalworth Poland (c. €1.8 million) and an increase in Group headcount.
• The significant improvements made in NOI, while maintaining administrative expenses at a reasonable level, also led to a
significant increase in Normalised EBITDA in H1-18 of 106%, as compared to H1-17.
• Financing costs in H1-18 decreased by 25% as compared to H1-17 as a result of the refinancing of the Group’s bank and
corporate debt, secured on our properties in Romania, using the proceeds of the Eurobond issued in June 2017.
2. Portfolio valuation and NAV
• During H1-18 the Company continued the development of the Globalworth Campus property, the Company’s largest office
development project to-date, as well as the development of Renault Bucharest Connected in cooperation with our joint venture
partner.
• €247.3 million worth of properties in Poland (€229.8 million) and Romania (€17.5 million) were acquired in H1-18. In addition,
€35.4 million of capex was incurred in H1-18 on properties either under development or completed and, combined with the €38.6
million increase in value of completed properties and properties under development during the period, the portfolio open market
value at 30 June 2018 increased significantly as compared to 31 December 2017, rising by c.€314 million or 17.3%.
• The chart below highlights the evolution of the Company’s EPRA NAV per share and portfolio open market value. Consistent
with the practice of other leading real estate companies, the Company will publish its NAV semi-annually, rather than on quarterly
basis as done prior to 2018; this follows the pattern of semi-annual financial reporting, and equivalent portfolio valuation dates.

The results for the period are set out in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on page 19.
In August 2018 the Company distributed an interim dividend of €0.27 per share in respect of the six-month financial period ended 30
June 2018. It has also announced its intention to distribute a dividend of €0.27 per share, payable in respect of the six-month financial
period ending 31 December 2018. The Company targets a sustainable and growing dividend, paid on a semi-annual basis, with an
intention to distribute the equivalent of at least 90% of the Company’s Funds from Operations (FFO).

FINANCIAL REVIEW
B. Analysis of results for the six months period ended 30 June 2018 (continued)
4. Financing activities
In March 2018, the Group successfully issued a second €550 million unsecured Eurobond at a coupon of 3% with seven years
duration (until March 2025), and the first under its €1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes programme. The transaction, despite being
finalised in a period of relative increased market volatility, received significant support from a variety of institutional investors,
predominantly from the UK and Continental Europe, resulting in the issue being oversubscribed by more than two times. Part of the
net proceeds of the Eurobond (c.€215 million) were utilised for the repayment in April 2018 of all but one of the bank loans secured
on our properties in Poland, thereby extending the flexibility of Globalworth’s predominantly unsecured debt structure across the
Group, with the remainder to be used for general corporate purposes. The first €550 million unsecured Eurobond issued in June 2017
is of five years duration (until June 2022) and carries a coupon of 2.875% per annum, while the first coupon was paid to Bondholders
in June 2018.
In terms of bank financing, in June 2018 the Group secured a €100 million, seven-year facility in Poland from a consortium consisting
of Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen and Deutsche Pfandbriefbank AG at a competitive interest rate, following the above-mentioned
repayment of all but one of the bank loan facilities secured on our properties in Poland. In addition, in August 2018 a new €46 million
long-term facility was signed with Banca Comerciala Romana (BCR, part of Erste Bank Group) for the financing of the development
costs of the Renault Bucharest Connected project, the development of which is progressing in accordance with the planned schedule.
Available bank loan facilities at 30 June 2018 comprise a €28 million unutilised revolving loan facility from Erste Group Bank AG (part
of Erste Bank Group), secured on our TAP property.
The total debt portfolio of the Group at 30 June 2018 comprised €1.1 billion of unsecured Eurobonds and c.€163 million of senior
long-term, secured loans. The weighted average remaining duration of the Group’s debt at 30 June 2018 is 5.6 years (compared to
5.4 years at 31 December 2017), while the weighted average interest on debt at 30 June 2018 amounted to 2.91% (versus 2.62% at
31 December 2017). The slight increase in the weighted average interest on debt during H1 2018 should be viewed in conjunction
with the increased percentage of unsecured debt (87% at 30 June 2018 versus 63% at 31 December 2017) and the increase in the
weighted average period to maturity of existing debt financing (5.6 years at 30 June 2018 versus 5.4 years at 31 December 2017).
Moreover, the Group has increased to 95% the proportion of debt with fixed interest rate charges, containing to the minimum possible
its exposure to interest rate risk. Currency exchange rate fluctuation risk is also at a very low level as the Group’s debt is denominated
in EUR, with an insignificant portion denominated in Romanian Lei (“RON”) and Polish Zloty (“PLN”).
The Group’s financial indebtedness is arranged with standard terms and financial covenants with no breaches of the aforementioned
values occurring for the period ended 30 June 2018. In addition, the Group’s credit facilities concluded with local banks in Romania
and Poland are secured with real estate mortgages, pledges on shares, receivables and loan subordination agreements in favour of
the financing banks.
In June 2018, our subsidiary, Globalworth Poland (“GPRE”), completed a €450 million equity capital raise at a share price of €1.57
per share. The transaction was fully subscribed by Globalworth (66.6%) and Growthpoint Properties (33.3%), resulting in €150 million
of new capital becoming available to fund further growth of the Polish portfolio. The remaining €300 million was used to partially repay
outstanding debt under various inter-company loans previously entered into between Globalworth Poland and Globalworth.
The net effect of this transaction was that Globalworth's shareholding in Globalworth Poland was reduced to 68.43% (from 71.66%),
while Growthpoint's shareholding in GPRE is 21.6%., The Company considers that this reduction in its shareholding is mitigated by
the benefit of greater scale and additional firepower for Globalworth Poland.
5. Cash flows
• Cash resources raised during the six months ended 30 June 2018 from new debt financing of €605.2 million (net proceeds).
• €147.1 million net proceeds from the direct participation of Growthpoint in the share capital increase of GPRE in June 2018.
• Cash utilised for the acquisition of completed properties and land for future development of €223.1 million.
• €33 million utilised on completed properties (mainly on fit-out works for tenants) and properties under development in H1-18.
• €234.7 million and €19.3 million utilised in the repayment of interest bearing loans and borrowings and debt interest payments
respectively.
• Cash utilised for the payment of dividends by the Company and the payment of dividends by GPRE to minority shareholders of
€31.4 million in total.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
B. Analysis of results for the six months period ended 30 June 2018 (continued)
6. Liquidity
Our Group seeks to maintain, at all times, sufficient liquidity to enable it to finance its ongoing, planned property investments, whilst
maintaining flexibility to quickly capture attractive new investment opportunities.
As a result of the successful equity and debt financing activities of the Company in December 2017 and March 2018 respectively,
cash and cash equivalents at 30 June 2018 amounted to c.€513 million. This places the Company in a strong position in respect to
available funding that can be applied to both the properties currently under development and new development projects in Romania,
as well as acquisitions of completed properties in Poland, and other opportunities that may arise.
7. Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The key risks which may have a material impact on the Group’s performance, together with the corresponding mitigating actions, are
presented on pages 52 to 57 of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2017, which is available at www.globalworth.com.
These risks comprise the following:
• Exposure to the economic environment in Romania and Poland and changes in the political or regulatory framework in Romania,
Poland or the European Union;
• Inability to execute planned acquisition of properties and lack of available financing;
• Counterparty credit risk;
• Risk of changes in interest rates and exchange rates;
• Risk of negative changes in the valuation of the portfolio;
• Inability to lease space and renew expiring leases;
• Inability to complete projects under development on time;
• Risk of breach of loan covenants;
• Risk of change in fiscal and tax regulations; and
• Compliance with fire, structural or other health and safety regulations.
There has been no significant change in these risks during the six months period ended 30 June 2018, and these risks are expected
to continue to remain relevant during the second half of 2018.
8. Going Concern
The Directors have considered the Company’s ability to continue to operate as a going concern based on the Management’s cash
flow projections for the 12 months subsequent to the date of approval of the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial
statements. The Directors believe that the Company would have sufficient cash resources to meet its obligations as they fall due and
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements as of and
for the six months ended 30 June 2018.
Interim Report and Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 30 June 2018 14
PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW
Standing Portfolio
Globalworth’s portfolio of standing properties grew further in H1-2018 with the acquisition of three new standing investments (seven office
properties) in Poland and the delivery of Globalworth Campus Tower 2 in Bucharest, which was under construction at the beginning of
the year and was subsequently delivered to the market. As at 30 June 2018, there were 28 standing investments in our portfolio with 47
standing properties in Romania and Poland.
Our standing portfolio, as of 30 June 2018, comprised 22 class “A” office investments (34 properties in total) and three mixed-use
investments (with seven properties in total) in central locations in Bucharest (Romania), Warsaw (Poland) and five of the largest office
markets/cities of Poland. In addition, we own a light industrial park with four facilities in Timisoara (Romania), a modern warehouse in
Pitesti (Romania), and part of a residential complex in Bucharest (Romania).
Globalworth’s total standing commercial GLA at the end of June 2018 had increased by 18.2% to reach 884.6k sqm, with the overall
standing portfolio GLA reaching 923.6k sqm (16.8% increase), impacted by the sale of certain residential units during the period. The
appraised value of our standing properties rose to c.€2.0 billion (as at 30 June 2018), representing a 18.3% increase compared to 31
December 2017.
We consider our portfolio to be modern, with almost all of our properties having been completed or refurbished since 2011, and c.62.9%
of our GLA and 68.1% of our standing combined portfolio value having been completed or refurbished since 2013. It is worth noting that
25 of our properties have been delivered or significantly refurbished since 2015, accounting for 50.6% of our GLA and 54.2%% of our
standing combined portfolio value. In addition, following the delivery of our development projects (Renault Bucharest Connected and
Globalworth Campus - Towers 3) and other future completions, the proportion of modern office stock in our portfolio will further increase
in the short-medium term.

properties) in the first half of 2018 which are green certified. WARTA Tower and the Quattro Business Park are both certified with
BREEAM Very Good accreditation or higher4.
Overall, our standing portfolio as of 30 June 2018 comprised 26 green certified properties, accounting for 71.4% of our standing

Developments
Globalworth made good progress on its development programme in the first half of 2018, which involved four properties located in
Bucharest. In April 2018 we delivered Tower 2 (28.2k sqm GLA) of our Globalworth Campus project and as at 30 June 2018, we had two
active developments (three properties) in Bucharest under construction, which upon completion will further increase our footprint of high
quality office space by 77.1k sqm.
The Renault Bucharest Connected project (“RBC”) is progressing well, with construction in line with the targeted timeline and the project
is expected to be delivered in Q1-2019. RBC is 100% pre-leased and, on completion, will house Groupe Renault’s new Headquarters in
Romania as well as a dedicated design centre for the development of future models of cars, in total offering 42.3k sqm of GLA and 1,000
parking spaces. Construction of the main Headquarters building structure has been completed and we are currently installing the façade
and performing the necessary installation and finishing works. Construction of the second building, a smaller design centre is also in
progress, with the structure now completed and further works in progress.
The second development currently in progress is Tower 3 (centre tower) of the Globalworth Campus project. The third tower, which
represents the second and final phase of the project, will upon completion offer high-quality Class “A” office space and other amenities
such as a 750-seat conference centre, spanning 34.8k sqm of GLA, and will also include c.500 parking spaces. The new building will
extend over 14 floors above ground and two underground levels and is expected to be completed in Q4-2019. Currently, excavation and
perimeter pilling is being completed and construction is in progress.
The total appraised value of our Developments as of 30 June 2018 was €58.0 million.
Land for Future Development
Globalworth owns land plots in four prime locations in Bucharest (new CBD, Herastrau Lake, historical CBD and Bucharest West),
covering a total surface of 28.0k sqm, in which office or mixed-use properties can be developed.
We have prioritised the lands in the new and historical CBD for future development, where we anticipate constructing office and mix-use
properties comprising c. 70k sqm GLA in total, subject to relevant approvals. In addition, the Company owns 30 hectares of land near
the TAP light-industrial park in Timisoara, which can be developed in phases delivering c.145k sqm of new high-quality light-industrial /
logistics space in the area.
We are currently progressing with the required preparatory activities, including performing planning and/or permitting, for this land bank
in Bucharest and Timisoara (TAP II) in order to be in a position to progress these schemes expediently.
The total appraised value of our land for future development as of 30 June 2018 was €40.2 million.

Basis of Preparation and Compliance
The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Group (or ‘financial statements’ or ‘consolidated financial statements’) as of and
for the six months ended 30 June 2018 have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard (IAS) 34 “Interim
Financial Reporting”. These consolidated financial statements are prepared in Euro (“EUR” or “€”), rounded to the nearest thousand,
being the functional currency and presentation currency of the Company. These financial statements have been prepared on a historical
cost basis, except for investment property, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, derivatives and financial assets at fair value
through other comprehensive income which are measured at fair value. The significant accounting policies adopted are set out in the
relevant notes to the financial statements and consistently applied throughout the periods presented except for the new and amended
IFRSs, which were adopted on 1 January 2018 (see note 26 for more details).
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained the financial review section of the interim report.
Accounting policies
These condensed consolidated financial statements apply the same accounting policies, presentation and methods of calculation as
those followed in the preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, which were
prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) and the
Companies (Guernsey) Law 2008, as amended. The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Interim Report should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017. On 1 January 2018, the Group
adopted certain new accounting policies where necessary to comply with amendments to IFRS, none of which had a material impact on
the consolidated results, financial position or cash flows of the Group (see note 26).
Interim Report and Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 30 June 2018 24
SECTION I: BASIS OF PREPARATION
1. Basis of Preparation continued
Basis of Consolidation
These condensed consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (‘the Group’)
as of and for the six months ended 30 June 2018. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated (refer to note 20) from the date of acquisition, being
the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date when such control ceases. The financial
statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the period from the date of obtaining control to 30 June, using consistent accounting
policies. All intra-group balances, transactions and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactions are eliminated in
full. Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets not held by the Group and are presented separately in
the income statement and within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position, separately from net assets and profit and loss
attributable to equity holders of the Company.
2. Critical Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make certain judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures
and the disclosures of contingent liabilities.
Selection of Functional Currency
The Company and its subsidiaries used their judgment, based on the criteria outlined in IAS 21 “The Effects of Changes in Foreign
Exchanges Rates”, and determined that the functional currency of all the entities is the EUR.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IAS 34 requires management to make certain judgements, estimates and
assumptions that effect reported amounts of revenue, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures and the
disclosures of contingent liabilities.
Further additional critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions are disclosed in the following notes to the financial
statements.
 Investment Property, see note 3 and Fair value measurement and related estimate and judgements, see note 4;
 Commitments (operating leases commitments – Group as lessor), see note 5;
 Taxation, see note 9;
 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, see note 13;
 Subsidiaries’ acquisitions, see note 20;
 Investment in Joint ventures, see note 21; and
 Investment in Subsidiaries, see note 22.

3.1 Other operating lease commitment
Other operating lease commitment of €1.93 million (2017: €2.3 million) as of 30 June 2018 (a similar corresponding amount was recorded
in trade and other payables as payables for tenant lease incentives) represents the Group’s estimated net cost for undertaking existing
operating leases in properties owned by third parties, as well as for the commitment to undertake additional operating lease expense,
under certain conditions, related to one of the Group’s tenants. The net cost is estimated by deducting from the operating lease expenses
the revenues from sub-letting the respective properties to third parties selected by the Group, for the unexpired portion of their leases.
Interim Report and Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 30 June 2018 26
SECTION II: INVESTMENT PROPERTY
4. Fair Value Measurement and Related Estimates and Judgements
Investment Property Measured at Fair Value
The Group’s investment property portfolio for Romania was valued by CBAR Research & Valuation Advisors SRL (“Coldwell Banker”)
and Cushman & Wakefield LLP (C&W). The Group’s investment property portfolio for Poland was valued by Knight Frank Sp. z.o.o
(“Knight Frank”) and CBRE Sp. z.o.o.(“CBRE”). All independent professionally qualified valuers hold a recognised relevant professional
qualification and have recent experience in the locations and segments of the investment properties valued using recognised valuation
techniques.
Our Property Valuation Approach and Process
The Group’s investment department includes a team that reviews the valuations performed by the independent valuers for financial
reporting purposes. For each independent valuation performed, the investment team, along with the finance team:
 verifies all major inputs to the independent valuation report;
 assesses property valuation movements when compared to the initial valuation report at acquisition or latest period end valuation
report; and
 holds discussions with the independent valuer.
Valuation Techniques, Key Inputs and Underlying Management’s Estimations and Assumptions
Valuation techniques comprise the discounted cash flows, the sales comparison approach and the residual value method.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a significant
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period, are described below.
The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared.
Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances
arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
Key information about fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) are disclosed below:

SECTION II: INVESTMENT PROPERTY
4. Fair Value Measurement and Related Estimates and Judgements continued
Sensitivity Analysis on Significant Inputs
In arriving at estimates of market values as at 30 June 2018 and 30 June 2017, the independent valuation experts used their market
knowledge and professional judgement and did not rely solely on historical transactional comparables. In these circumstances, there was
a greater degree of uncertainty in estimating the market values of investment properties than would have existed in a more active market.
The assumptions on which the property valuations have been based include, but are not limited to, rental value per sqm, discount rate,
exit yield, cost to complete, comparable market transactions for land bank for further development, tenant profile for the rented properties,
and the present condition of the properties. These assumptions are market standard and in line with the International Valuation Standards
(‘IVS’). Generally, a change in the assumption made for the rental value (per sqm per annum) is accompanied by a similar change in the
rent growth per annum and discount rate (and exit yield) and an opposite change in the other inputs.
A quantitative sensitivity analysis, in isolation, of the most sensitive inputs used in the independent valuations performed, as of the
statement of financial position date, are set out below:

value per month, per 25 bps change in 5% change in sales prices per

Commitments for Investment Property
As at 30 June 2018 the Group had agreed construction contracts with third parties and is consequently committed to future capital
expenditure in respect of completed investment property of €3.5 million (2017: €3.4 million), investment property under development of
€48 million (2017: €13.6 million) and had committed with tenants to incur fit-out works of €7.3 million (2017: €7.3 million). The Group’s

Operating Leases Commitments – Group as Lessor
Judgements Made for Properties Under Operating Leases
The Group has determined, based on an evaluation of the terms and conditions of the arrangements, that it retains all the significant
risks and rewards of ownership of the investment properties leased to third parties, therefore, accounts for these leases as operating
leases. The duration of these leases is one year or more (2017: one year or more) and rentals are subject to annual upward revisions
based on the consumer price index.

€’000 €’000
Current income tax expense 2,683 277
Deferred income tax expense (income) 4,890 (472)
7,573 (195)
The income tax rate applicable to the Company in Guernsey is nil. The subsidiaries in Romania, the Netherlands, Poland, Luxembourg
and Cyprus are subject to income taxes in respect of local sources of income. The current income tax charge of €2.7 million (2017: €0.3
million) represents tax charges on profit arising in the subsidiaries in Poland, Romania and Cyprus (2017: Romania and Cyprus). Tax
charges on profit arising in Poland, Luxembourg, Romania, the Netherlands and Cyprus are subject to corporate income tax at the rate
of 19% (15% for small entities where revenue is less than €1.0 million for taxpayers starting a new business for their first tax year in
operation), 27.08% (nominal rate of 26.01% for 2018 and lower tax rate for small entities if taxable profit does not exceed €30,000), 16%,
25% (20% for tax on profits up to €0.2 million), and 12.5%, respectively.
The Group’s subsidiaries registered in Luxembourg, Cyprus and the Netherlands need to comply with the tax regulations in the respective
countries. however, the Group does not expect any taxable income, other than dividend and interest income (excluding Luxembourg),
which are the most significant future sources of income of the Group companies registered in these countries. However, interest income
is subject to corporate income tax at the rate of 12.5% in Cyprus and ranges from 20% to 25%, depending on total taxable profit (20%
for tax on profits up to €0.2 million), in the Netherlands. Dividend income is typically exempt under participation exemption regime
available in Cyprus, the Netherlands and Luxembourg or subject to standard corporate income tax rate, if the conditions for participation
exemption are not met.
Judgements and Assumptions Used in the Computation of Current Income Tax Liability
Uncertainties exist, particularly in Romania and Poland where the Group has significant operations, with respect to the interpretation of
complex tax regulations, changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income. Differences arising between the actual
results and the assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and
expense already recorded. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing
in the respective company’s domicile. In Romania and Poland, the tax position is open to further verification for five years and no
subsidiary in Romania and Poland have had a corporate income tax audit in the last five years.
Reconciliation between Applicable and Effective Tax Rates

Unsecured Corporate Bond
In March 2018, the Group issued a €550 million unsecured Eurobond (Loan 37). The seven-year euro-denominated Bond matures on
29 March 2025 and carries a fixed interest rate of 3.0%. The net proceeds were used for refinancing existing debt (loans 26-31 and 35-
36), acquisition of investment properties and general corporate purposes.
Secured facilities
In the second quarter of 2018 the Group has entered into new loan agreements (loans 38 and 39). The new facilities mainly carry fixed
interest rates (Loan 38) and partly (loan 39) floating interest rates. The net proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of investment
property as disclosed in subsequent events note 28. Similarly, during the period the Company withdrew from an existing revolving loan
facility from Erste Group Bank AG (part of Erste Bank Group), secured on our TAP property (loan 40) for an amount of €2 million.
Secured bank loans are secured by investment properties with a carrying value of €309.8 million at 30 June 2018 (2017: €796.0 million)
and also carry pledges on rent receivable balances of €3.6 million (2017: €9.6 million), tenant deposits of nil (2017: €6.1 million), VAT
receivable balances of €1.0 million (2017: €1.3 million) and a moveable charge on the bank accounts (see note 15).

SECTION IV: FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
12. Interest-Bearing Loans and Borrowings continued
Other Disclosures
All the loans are subject to certain financial covenants, which are calculated based on the individual financial statements of the respective
subsidiaries or the consolidated financial statements of the Group. The Group is in compliance with all financial covenants and there
were no payment defaults during the period ended 30 June 2018. Financial covenants include the gross loan-to-value ratio (“LTV”) with
maximum values ranging from 60% – 70%, the loan to cost ratio (“LTC”) with a maximum value of 75%, the debt service cover ratio
(‘DSCR’) / interest cover ratio (“ICR”) with minimum values ranging from 100% – 300% and the secured leveraged ratio of maximum
value of 30%. LTV is calculated as the loan value divided by the market value of the relevant property (for a calculation date), LTC is
calculated by dividing the value of drawdowns by the total project cost and DSCR (historical and/or projected, as the case may be, for a
12-month period) and ICR is calculated as net operating income divided by the debt service / interest. As of 30 June 2018, the Group
had undrawn borrowing facilities of €28 million (2017: €32.7 million).
13. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss

Right of First Offer Agreements ('ROFO')
The fair value of the financial assets is individually determined by taking into account number of factors e.g. percentage of completion
('PoC'), leasing progress. The maturity dates presented in the table above are stated in the agreements, however the planned repayment
dates of debentures would take place upon completion of each ROFO project. As at 30 June 2018, a gain of €1.7 million from the fair
valuation of above financial instruments was recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
In 2017 prior to acquisition date, GPRE and its subsidiaries signed an agreement for the acquisition of 25% stakes in ROFO projects,
being developed by Echo Investment S.A. (“ROFO Bonds”). Under the agreement, GPRE (the “Bondholder”) will purchase bonds issued
by the respective limited partners of all of the respective ROFO SPVs (the “ROFO Agreement”). The ROFO Agreement covers all of the
ROFO Assets. Echo indirectly holds 100% of the shares or interest in the ROFO SPVs and the ROFO SPVs are developing the ROFO
Assets. GPRE intended to invest (indirectly through the Bondholder), on the terms and conditions set out in the ROFO Agreement, in
each of the ROFO Assets the amount of 25% of the funds required by each of the ROFO SPVs (less the external construction bank
financing at a loan to construction ratio of 60%) to complete the development of each respective ROFO Asset. Based on the construction
budget presented by Echo to the Issuer in connection with the execution of the ROFO Agreement, the amount of the contribution (the
investment) made by the Company under the ROFO Agreement amounts to €9.9 million.
The redemption date for all the series of the ROFO Bonds is 12 June 2032, and the ROFO Bonds will be redeemed by way of the
payment of a sum equal to the nominal value of each of the bonds. The ROFO Bonds accrue interest at a fixed interest rate in the
amounts of and on the conditions provided in the terms and conditions of the ROFO Bonds. Final amount of interest will be adjusted
based on the terms of the accompanied option agreement so that it reflects actual development profit realised on each of the projects.
The ROFO Bonds have been issued as unsecured bonds.

€8.6 million (US$10 million), receiving a 4.99% stake in Mindspace Ltd (see further details on page 9 of the Interim Report).
At initial recognition the Group, at its sole irrevocable option under IFRS 9, designated the unquoted equity investment as financial assets
at fair value through other comprehensive income. Under this option, qualifying dividends will be recognized in profit or loss. Changes in
fair value will be recognized in other comprehensive income and will not be reclassified to profit and loss on future impairment, if any, or
derecognition. At 30 June 2018, no fair value gain or loss was recognised in other comprehensive income as there was no significant
change in the net assets of the investee since the acquisition date and there were no indicators of impairment.

bank and in hand includes restricted cash balances of €6.9 million (2017: €9.7 million) and short-term deposits include restricted deposits
of €2.8 million (2017: €9.3 million).
16. Financial Risk Management – Objective and Policies
The Group is exposed to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:
 market risk (including currency risk, interest rate risk);
 credit risk; and
 liquidity risk.
Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Group’s market risks arise from open positions in: (a) foreign currencies; and (b) interest-bearing assets and liabilities, to the extent
that these are exposed to general and specific market movements.
i) Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has entities registered in several EU countries, with the majority of operating transactions arising from its activities in Romania
and Poland.
Therefore, the Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk, primarily with respect to the Romanian Lei (RON) and Polish Zloty (PLN).
Foreign exchange risk arises in respect of those recognised monetary financial assets and liabilities that are not in the functional currency
of the Group.

Foreign Currency Sensitivity Analysis
As of the statement of financial position date, the Group is mainly exposed to foreign exchange risk in respect of the exchange rate
fluctuations of the RON and PLN. The following table details the Group’s sensitivity (impact on income statement before tax and equity)
to a 5% devaluation in RON, PLN, USD and GBP exchange rates against the Euro, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
The 5% sensitivity rate represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The
sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end
for a 5% appreciation in the Euro against other currencies.

GBP 1 1 1 1
A 5% devaluation of the Euro against the above currencies would have had an equal but opposite impact on the above currencies to
the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
ii) Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate price risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates relative to
the interest rate that applies to the financial instrument. Interest rate cash flows risk is the risk that the interest cost will fluctuate over
time.
The Group’s interest rate risk principally arises from interest-bearing loans and borrowings. As at 30 June 2018, 5.4% (2017: 37.3%) of
the total outstanding borrowings carried variable interest rates (including the 1M and 3M EURIBOR, 1M ROBOR, National Bank Poland
reference rate less social indicator, and 1M WIBOR as bases) which expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. In order to minimise
this risk, the Group hedged 28.0% (2017: 5.9%) of such variable interest rate borrowings with fixed-variable interest rate swap and
interest rate cap instruments. Based on the Group’s debt balances at 30 June 2018, an increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the
WIBOR, EURIBOR or ROBOR will result in an increase or decrease (net of tax) in the result for the year of €1.0 million (2017: €9.3
million), with a corresponding impact on equity for the same amount. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign
currency rates, remain constant.
The Group has Euro denominated long-term borrowings, Loan 25, 37 and 38 (2017: Loan 25), at fixed rates which constitute 94.6%
(2017: 62.7%) of the total debt. The facilities are payable in June 2022, March 2025 and May 2025 respectively. As a consequence, the
Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk, which has been disclosed under IFRS but will not have an impact on the income
statement. As of 30 June 2018, the fair value was higher by €36.6 million (2017: €33.7 million) than the carrying value as disclosed below
in fair value hierarchy table.

Credit Risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The
Group’s policy is to trade with recognised and creditworthy third parties. The Group’s exposure is continuously monitored and spread
amongst approved counterparties. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk, by class of financial asset, is equal to their carrying
values at the statement of financial position date.

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and other comprehensive income
The Group places funds in financial instruments issued by reputable real estate companies with high credit worthiness.
Trade Receivables – Net of Provision
There is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group has a large number of tenants, a few
of which are part of multinational groups, internationally dispersed, as disclosed in the Leasing review of Interim Report. For related
parties, including the joint venture, it is assessed that there is no significant risk of non‑recovery.
Estimates and Assumptions Used for Impairment of Trade Receivables
The Group assesses when there is sufficient objective evidence to require the impairment of individual trade receivables. It does this on
the basis of the age of the relevant receivables, external evidence of the credit status of the counterparty and the status of any disputed
amounts.
Impairments and adoption of IFRS 9
The Group’s trade receivables do not contain any financing component and mainly represent lease receivables. Therefore, the Group
adopted the simplified approach under IFRS 9 and measured the loss allowance based on a provision matrix in order to estimate the
provision on initial recognition and throughout the life of the receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECL (Expected Credit Losses).
The movements in the provision for impairment of receivables during the respective periods were as follows:

SECTION IV: FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
16. Financial Risk Management – Objective and Policies continued
The customer balances which were overdue but not provisioned are due to the fact that the related customers committed and started to
pay the outstanding balances subsequent to the period end. Further deposits payable to tenants may be withheld by the Group in part
or in whole if receivables due from the tenant are not settled or in case of other breaches of contractual terms.
Other Receivables
This balance relates to sundry debtors of €3.9 million (2017: €1.0 million) and consideration receivable from Sellers of €1.8 million (2017:
€0.3 million). Management has made due consideration of the credit risk associated with these balances resulting in no impairment being
identified.
VAT and Other Taxes Receivable
This balance relates to corporate income tax paid in advance, VAT and other taxes receivable from the Romanian tax authorities. The
balances are not considered to be subject to significant credit risk as all the amounts receivable from Government authorities are secured
under sovereign warranty.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is very small, since the cash and cash equivalents are held at reputable banks in different
countries. The most significant part of the cash and cash equivalents balance is kept at the Company level with international banks having
long-term credit rating range of A+ and short-term credit rating of A-1, as well as in Romania in local branches of reputable international
banks with credit rating of BBB and in Poland surplus funds from operating activities are deposited only for a short-term period, which
are highly liquid, with reputable institutions.
Loan receivable from joint venture
Loan receivable from joint venture is neither past due nor impaired.
Liquidity Risk
The Group’s policy on liquidity is to maintain sufficient liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. Ultimate responsibility for
liquidity risk management rests with management. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and planning
and close monitoring of cash flows. The Group expects to meet its financial liabilities through the various available liquidity sources,
including a secure rental income profile, further equity raises, undrawn committed borrowing facilities and, in the medium term, debt
refinancing.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.

16. Financial Risk Management – Objective and Policies continued
The tables above present the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be
required to pay, and includes both interest and principal cash flows. As the amount of contractual undiscounted cash flows related to
bank borrowings is based on variable rather than fixed interest rates, the amount disclosed is determined by reference to the conditions
existing at the period end, that is, the actual spot interest rates effective at the end of period are used for determining the related
undiscounted cash flows.
Financial Instruments for which Fair Values are Disclosed
Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments, other than those with
carrying amounts that are reasonable approximations of their fair values.

The fair value of financial liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between
willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. When determining the fair values of interest-bearing loans and borrowings and
finance lease obligations the Group used the DCF method with inputs such as discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as
at the statement financial position date. Specifically, for the Eurobonds, their fair value is calculated on the basis of their quoted market
price. The own non-performance risk at the statement of financial position date was assessed to be insignificant.
Other current financial liabilities
Other current financial liabilities represent the mark-to-market value of an interest rate swap, obtained from the counterparty financial
institution, at €2.3 million (2017: €2.6 million) at the end of the current year. The fair value of derivative was developed in accordance
with the requirements of IFRS 13. Under the terms of the swap agreement, the Group is entitled to receive a floating rate of 1M EURIBOR
at a notional amount of €18.81 million and is required to pay a fixed rate of interest of 3.62% p.a. on the said notional amount in four
quarterly instalments, with maturity date of June 2022. The movement in fair value recognised in the income statement for the year was
a financial income of €0.27 million (2017: €0.6 million).
The Group assessed that the fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities, such as trade and other receivables, guarantees
retained by tenants, cash and cash equivalents, income tax receivable and payables, trade and other payables, guarantees retained
from contractors and deposits from tenants, approximate their carrying amounts largely due to short-term maturities and low transaction
costs of these instruments as of the statement of financial position date.

18.1 Executive Share Option Plan
Under the plan, the Directors of the Group were awarded share option warrants as remuneration for the services performed. The share
options granted to the Directors of the Group are equity settled.
In 2013, the Group granted warrants to the Founder and the Directors which entitle each holder to subscribe for Ordinary shares in the
Company at an exercise price of €5.00 per share if the market price of an Ordinary share, on a weighted average basis over 60
consecutive days, exceeds a specific target price and the holder is employed on such date. The contractual term of each warrant granted
is 10 years. There are no cash settlement alternatives and the Group does not have the intention to offer cash settlement for these
warrants.
The following table analyses the total cost of the executive share option plan (Warrants), together with the number of options outstanding:

The fair value of the warrants was estimated at the grant date (i.e. July 2013) at €0.073 per share. There have been no cancellations or
modifications to any of the plans during the year. On 3 January 2018, 30,000 of the vested warrants were exercised at €5.00 per share
under the contractual terms for an amount of €0.15 million and a corresponding €3,000 share-based payment reserve was also
transferred to share capital.

to the Company pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement concluded between the Company and GIAL. The 0.19 million new
shares rank pari passu with the existing shares of the Company. The Ordinary shares have been issued at €8.75 per Ordinary share
(market price on the issue date being €9.15 per Ordinary share) and are subject to the vesting conditions set out in the performance

19. Capital Management
The Company has no legal capital regulatory requirement. The Group’s policy is to maintain a strong equity capital base so as to maintain
investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the continuous development of its business. The Board considers from time to
time whether it may be appropriate to raise new capital by a further issue of shares.
The Group monitors capital primarily using an LTV ratio, which is calculated as the amount of outstanding debt divided by the open
market value of its investment property portfolio as certified by external valuers. As at 30 June 2018 the gross LTV ratio was 60.7%
(2017: 49.5%) and the net LTV ratio amounted to 36.2% (2017: 34.3%).

SECTION VI: BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES
• This section includes details about Globalworth’s subsidiaries, new business and assets acquired, investment in joint ventures,
goodwill and related impact on the statement of comprehensive income and cash flows.
20. Subsidiaries acquisitions
Judgements and assumptions used for Business combinations and asset acquisitions
At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents an acquisition of a business or an acquisition of an
asset. Where an integrated set of activities are acquired in addition to the property more specifically the consideration is made of the
extent to which significant processes are acquired, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination. Moreover, the Group
considers when two or more transactions are linked (by common counterparties, contractual clauses, funding etc.) whether they are part
of a single business combination.
When the acquisition of subsidiary or property does not represent a business, it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets
and liabilities. The cost to acquire the entity is allocated between the identifiable assets and liabilities of the entity based upon their
relative fair values at acquisition date and no goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.
Asset acquisitions
As disclosed in note 22, during the six-month period ended 30 June 2018 the Group acquired 100% of the issued shares in Warta Tower
Sp. z o.o. Sp. k., holding an office building called “Warta Tower”, West Gate II - Projekt Echo - 114 Sp. z o.o. Sp. k., holding an office
building called “West Link”, and Blackwyn Investments Sp. z o.o., holding an office building called “Quattro Business Park”. The
acquisitions were judged as asset acquisitions on acquisition date as per the criteria outlined above for a gross cash consideration of
€227.1 million. The aggregate fair values of investment properties, cash and cash equivalents, other current assets and current liabilities
acquired were €228.3 million, €2 million, €2.9 million and €4.2 million, respectively.

In February 2017, the Group’s subsidiary Minory Investments Limited entered into a joint venture agreement with Diti Holding Limited
and through which it acquired a 50% shareholding interest in Elgan Offices SRL (“Elgan O”), an unlisted company in Romania, currently
owning an investment property under development in Bucharest, Romania.
Judgements and assumptions used for Joint ventures
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant
activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. The considerations made in determining significant influence or
joint control are similar to those necessary to determine control over subsidiaries. Following such assessment, the Group’s investment
was classified as a joint venture.
As at 30 June 2018, the Group determined that there is no objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is impaired. The
financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group. The joint venture had no other contingent
liabilities or commitments as at 30 June 2018 (2017: €nil), except construction commitments as disclosed in note 5.

24. Segmental Information
The Group earns revenue and holds non-current assets (investment properties) in Romania and Poland, the geographical area of
its operations. For investment property, discrete financial information is provided on a property-by-property basis (including those
under construction) to members of executive management, which collectively comprise the Executive Directors of the Group. The
information provided is Net Operating Income (‘NOI’) (gross rental income less property expenses) and property valuation
gains/losses. The individual properties are aggregated into segments with similar economic characteristics, such as the nature of
the property and the occupier market it serves. Management considers that this is best achieved by aggregating into the office,
mixed use and other segments however residential segment is disclosed separately as it meets the quantitative threshold of IFRS
8.
Consequently, the Group is considered to have four reportable operating segments: the Offices segment (acquires, develops,
leases and manages offices and spaces), the Residential segment (builds, acquires, develops and leases apartments), High street
mixed used and the Other segment (acquires, develops, leases and manages industrial spaces and corporate holding office).
Share-based payments expense is not allocated to individual segments as underlying instruments are managed at Group basis.
Segment assets and liabilities reported to executive management on a segmental basis are set out below:

26. New and Amended Standards
Starting from 1 January 2018 the Group adopted the following new and amended standards and interpretations. The new standards
and amendments had no significant impact (the impact from the adoption of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 is disclosed below) on the Group’s
financial position and performance.
Effective
Narrow scope amendments and new Standards date
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments Jan-18
IFRS 15 Clarifications: Revenue from Contracts with Customers Jan-18

IFRS 2 Classification and measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions Jan-18
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle Jan-18
IFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration Jan-18
a) Adoption of IFRS 15
The Group adopted IFRS 15 on 1 January 2018 without restarting prior year figures.
IFRS 15 does not apply to rental income, but only applies to service charge income, marketing income and fit-out services income
generated by the Group. The Group has identified very few lease agreements having an insignificant amount that would be
reclassified from the rental revenues to service charge revenue starting from 1 January 2018. However, this would not impact the
net operating income (NOI) and would reclassify revenues from ‘Rental income’ to ‘Service charge income’. The reclassification of
such amounts was not material for the Group as at 31 December 2017 and 30 June 2018. There was no impact on fit-out services
income for contract in progress at 31 December 2017.
b) Classification and reconciliation of financial assets and liabilities upon the initial application of IFRS 9
The classification of Group’s financial assets and liabilities according to IAS 39 and IFRS 9 as at 1 January 2018 are presented
below.
The table below summarises the carrying value reconciliation of the Group's financial assets upon the transition from the previous
classification categories under IAS 39 at 31 December 2017 to the new classification categories under IFRS 9 at 1 January 2018.
From the adoption of IFRS 9 there was no impact on the statement of profit or loss for the six months ended 30 June 2018 and on
the statement of other comprehensive income as at 1 January 2018.
The Group’s financial liabilities were classified and measured at amortised cost according to IAS 39 (except when required to be
measured at fair value through profit or loss such as financial liabilities related to derivatives) until 31 December 2017 and according
to IFRS 9 starting from 1 January 2018. From adoption of IFRS 9 there was no impact on the statement of profit or loss for the six
months ended 30 June 2018 and statement of financial position as at 30 June 2018.

SECTION VII: OTHER DISCLOSURES
27. Contingencies
Legal Claims
One of the Company’s subsidiaries (the ‘Subsidiary’) is involved in court proceedings with a third party. Following the third party’s
decision to terminate the lease agreement signed with the Subsidiary, the Subsidiary enforced the c.€3.16 million bank letter of
guarantee provided by the third party, on the grounds that the third party has unlawfully terminated the agreement. The third party
claimed that the Subsidiary was not entitled to enforce the guarantee and requested before the court that the Subsidiary reimburses
the guarantee amount. On top of the cashed-in guarantee, the Subsidiary has submitted a court claim against the third party
claiming an amount of c.€24.7 million representing penalties as per the agreement for the unlawful termination of the agreement
by the third party. The presiding judge accepted the Subsidiary’s claim to merge the two claims into one court case and resolved
the two cases together. On 19 July 2017, the presiding judge announced that it has accepted the third party’s claim and denied
the Subsidiary’s claim. Based on the legal advice it has received, management has filed an appeal against the decision and
believes that the court of appeal will embrace its view that the Subsidiary acted in accordance with the applicable law and the
remedies available to it under the agreement when enforcing the bank letter of guarantee provided by the third party.
Taxation
All amounts due to State authorities for taxes have been paid or accrued at the balance sheet date. The tax system in Romania
and Poland undergoes a consolidation process and is being harmonised with the European legislation. Different interpretations
may exist at the level of the tax authorities in relation to the tax legislation that may result in additional taxes and penalties payable.
Where the State authorities have findings from reviews relating to breaches of tax laws, and related regulations these may result
in: confiscation of the amounts in case; additional tax liabilities being payable; fines and penalties (that are applied on the total
outstanding amount). As a result, the fiscal penalties resulting from breaches of the legal provisions may result in a significant
amount payable to the State. The Group believes that it has paid in due time and in full all applicable taxes, penalties and penalty
interests in the applicable extent.
Transfer Pricing
According to the applicable relevant tax legislation in Romania and Poland, the tax assessment of related party transactions is
based on the concept of market value for the respective transfers. Following this concept, the transfer prices should be adjusted
so that they reflect the market prices that would have been set between unrelated companies acting independently (i.e. based on
the “arm’s length principle”). It is likely that transfer pricing reviews will be undertaken in the future in order to assess whether the
transfer pricing policy observes the “arm’s length principle” and therefore no distortion exists that may affect the taxable base of
the tax payer in Romania and Poland.
28. Subsequent Events
On 11 July 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors has approved the payment of an interim dividend in respect
of the six-month financial period ended 30 June 2018 of €0.27 per ordinary share, which was paid on 17 August 2018 to the eligible
shareholders.
On 12 July 2018, the Group concluded an agreement based on which it purchased 100% shares in Spektrum Tower spółka z
ograniczoną odpowiedzialnością, holding legal rights to the office building Spektrum Tower in Warsaw, Poland. The purchase price
of €101 million was adjusted to the acquired subsidiary’s cash and working capital at acquisition date. Final price may be adjusted
due to retentions. The annual contracted rental income of the property generated by the occupancy ratio of 92.5% amounts to €6.3
million.
