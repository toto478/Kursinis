Report on review of consolidated condensed interim financial
statements
To the shareholders of AKROPOLIS GROUP, UAB
Introduction
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated condensed interim statement of financial position
of AKROPOLIS GROUP, UAB and its subsidiaries (the ‘Group’) as at 30 June 2023 and the related
consolidated condensed interim statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash
flows for the six-month period then ended, and the notes to the consolidated condensed interim
financial statements, which include significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.
Management is responsible for the preparation of these consolidated condensed interim financial
statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards as adopted by the European Union. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on these
consolidated condensed interim financial statements based on our review.
Scope of review
We conducted our review in accordance with International Standard on Review Engagements 2410,
'Review of interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity'. A review of
consolidated condensed interim financial statements consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures.
A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International
Standards on Auditing and consequently does not enable us to obtain assurance that we would
become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not
express an audit opinion.
Conclusion
Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the
accompanying consolidated condensed interim financial statements do not give a true and fair view of
the consolidated financial position of the Group as at 30 June 2023, and of its consolidated financial
performance and its consolidated cash flows for the six-month period then ended in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union.

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
The Group is currently involved in legal proceedings (two cases) related to acquisitionof state-owned land by "Vingio Turtas",
UAB on 4 November 2005, which is intended for the construction of Vingis Akropolis. The validity of part of the agreement on
sale/purchase of state-owned land (Agreement) has been challenged due to an alleged breach of the claimants’ rights to
property restitution.
The National Land Service has adopted decisions favourable to "Vingio Turtas", UAB that were appealed to Vilnius Regional
Administrative Court (court of first instance).
Bythedecisiondeclaredon21February2022,VilniusRegionalAdministrativeCourtdismissedtheclaimants’appealregarding
the decisions adopted by the National Land Service. The claimants appealed against the decision of Vilnius Regional
Administrative Court with the request to annul the decision and to refer the case back to the court of first instance for re-
examination. "Vingio Turtas", UAB provided a response to the appeal within the deadline set by the court. The case was
examinedbythewayof a written procedureattheSupremeAdministrativeCourtof Lithuania.Byitsrulingof30August2023,
the Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania upheld the applicants’ appeal and referred the case back to the court of first
instance for re-examination.
The legal proceedings do not affect the development of Vingis Akropolis project. In the event of favourable outcome to the
claimants, the land plot for the construction of Vingis Akropolis might be materially reduced in size, but the implementation of any
decision in favour of the claimants would be legally complicated and would give rise to a number of legal issues.
