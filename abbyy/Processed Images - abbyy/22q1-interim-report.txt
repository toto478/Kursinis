CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
The first quarter was overshadowed by the geopolitical and economic impacts of the invasion of Ukraine, following which we
focused on ensuring continuity of service to customers – individuals and enterprises resident in the Baltic countries - and
supporting our staff, while working with others to assist displaced Ukrainians arriving in the region. We continue to apply
sanctions and support those most affected. We made it easier for citizens of the Ukraine to open an account with us and we
waived fees on all payments to accounts held with Ukrainian banks. In addition, we made donations to three Baltic-based
charities assisting refugees who have fled Ukraine. To support our staff, we modified the content of our wellbeing programme,
established emotional support groups and offered individual psychological counselling.
We also evaluated our credit portfolio. We have no direct exposure to companies domiciled in Russia, Belarus or Ukraine, and
next to no exposure to residents of these countries. Despite an insignificant number of new non-performing loans, and limited
indirect exposure, we placed on watch list those corporate exposures we believe could be impacted by higher geopolitical risks
or high inflation, or exposures for whom energy costs are significant. This action increased our stage 2 loans by 567 million EUR.
As we adjusted our way of doing business to reflect this new operating environment, we improved our business performance,
raised our efficiency, and so boosted our net profits as compared to the same quarter last year. As we support our customers,
our staff, and the societies we serve, we have three priorities. First, to do more business with more customers – notably more
mortgage and consumer lending, and lending to SME customers - widen our product offering, and improve customer
experience. Second, to raise our efficiency and enhance our IT operations. And third, to build our unique culture.
We have substantial work ahead of us to realise these goals, but I am encouraged by our continued progress in the first quarter.
Despite the uncertain environment and understandable caution from customers, we grew loans to individuals and businesses
by 1.8% in the quarter. We launched instant payments in Lithuania, modernised our ATM network, and signed an agreement to
acquire Maksekeskus, the leading e-commerce payments service provider in the Baltic region. We remain focused on ensuring
IT stability as we improve our services, products, and performance. To enhance our evaluation of ESG risk we drafted strategies
for those sectors most exposed to climate risk.
We generated a net profit of 15.0 million EUR in the quarter, as compared to 5.8 million EUR in the same quarter last year. This
improvement was driven principally by an 8% increase in revenue as we grew net interest income and a 23% reduction in
expenses following the completion of several planned initiatives during 2021, offset in part by higher credit loss allowances. Our
return on equity improved to 3.9% from 1.4%.
Our liquidity and capital positions remain strong. At quarter end our Common Equity, Tier 1 and Total Capital Ratios were 21.2%.
All our capital is composed of equity. We are reviewing our capital levels and structure to ensure alignment with our plans and
outlook, and improve the efficiency of our capital resources.
The outlook for the Baltic region is strong. While the impacts from the invasion of Ukraine and the spectre of price inflation are
near term challenges for the Baltic countries, our path and ambitions are clear. I look forward to Luminor doing more business,
more effectively, with more individuals and businesses across our home markets of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In so doing,
we will maintain our strong financial standing, exercise prudent risk management, and fulfil our wider obligations.

Profit for the quarter was 15.0 million EUR, almost triple that of the same quarter last year. An increase in Total operating income
of 5.8 million EUR and a 15.9 million EUR decrease in Total operating expenses were offset partially by an increase of 11.3 million
EUR in credit loss allowances.
Total operating income was 82.7 million EUR, an increase of 7.5%, as compared to the prior year first quarter. Net interest
income increased by 6.5 million EUR to 63.1 million EUR. Interest income increased by 2.3 million EUR as continued pressure on
lending margins was offset by growing lending volumes, while interest expense fell by 4.2 million EUR mainly as we reduced our
balances of excess liquidity. Net fee and commission income increased by 0.4 million EUR with growth in fees from credit
products, daily banking and trade finance, while fees from pensions fell. Net other operating income decreased by 1.1 million
EUR, driven by payment of a guarantee fee to the European Investment Bank in relation to our synthetic securitization
transaction.
Total operating expenses were 54.6 million EUR, a decrease of 22.6% as compared to the same period last year, driven by lower
IT-related expenses, and consulting and professional services, following the completion of several planned initiatives during
2021. We continue to make considerable investments in our IT operations. Our cost-to-income ratio improved significantly to
66.0% from 91.7% in the same quarter last year.
We incurred a credit loss allowance of 11.4 million EUR this quarter as compared to 0.1 million EUR in the first quarter last year.
Allowances increased as we updated macroeconomic scenarios and changed their probabilities, made a provision for a new
single larger non-performing exposure, and placed on watch list those exposures we believe could be impacted by higher
geopolitical risks or high inflation or exposures for whom energy costs are significant. The increase was partly offset by a halving
of the management overlay, as the risk from COVID-19 decreased. More details about these changes can be found in the ‘Asset
Quality’ section, below.
In the quarter we generated a return on equity of 3.9%, as measured on an annualised basis, as compared to 1.4% in the same
period last year.

We remain focused on growing lending, increasing the number of active customers, and raising customer satisfaction.
Despite the uncertain environment and understandable caution amongst customers, we maintained new mortgage lending
volumes at the same level as last year and grew the amount of new consumer lending and leasing. Growth was aided by our
introduction of specialised consumer loans to finance the installation of solar panels and heat pump heating systems in private
houses. This was part of a wider initiative to direct more funding towards sustainable projects, and followed our launch last year
of ‘Green car’ loans which offer lower interest rates for low emission cars.
We continued to develop our digital solutions and improve our customer experience. We introduced automated loan
application screening in Estonia and the number of active customers who are using ApplePay or GooglePay increased by 10,000
over the quarter. Our focus on service and cross-sales increased both the number of card transactions and transaction volumes
by more than 10% as compared to the first quarter of last year.
Contributions to third pillar pension funds increased by 11% with growth in all three Baltic countries, while assets under
management in our pension index funds ‘Sustainable Future’ reached 10 million EUR for the first time.
To address possible customer concerns about the impact of the invasion of Ukraine we provided updates on developments,
and organised webinars and produced podcasts. To support refugees from Ukraine we simplified our account opening process
for Ukrainian citizens, added Ukrainian language pages to our website and visited refugee centres to help with opening accounts.

We advanced 390 million EUR of new loans in the first quarter, 31% more than in the same quarter last year.
In the immediate aftermath of the invasion of Ukraine, large corporate customers suspended their investment activities for
several weeks, though by the second half of March there were signs of normalisation of activity, while business activity in the
SME segment did not change significantly.
The transaction pipeline is growing slowly across all corporate segments. The main driver of new volumes is increased demand
for working capital financing in response to inflation and supply chain risks, and is visible in many economic sectors. There is
demand for leases in all sectors, especially agriculture, as well as trade finance products The latter led to growth in net fee
income during the quarter.
The depressed activity in the European credit markets following the invasion of Ukraine, combined with widening risk premiums
for Baltic borrowers, meant that levels of activity were low in the Baltic debt capital markets in the first quarter.
We aim to contribute to the sustainable growth of the Baltic economies. We aspire to support our customers on this journey
and ensure that they consider climate risk and contribute to climate expectations. To aid this process, we hosted for corporate
customers the first in a planned series of climate seminars.

Loans to customers in the first quarter increased by 1.8%, Deposits from customers increased by 2.5%, while the total balance
grew just under 4%. At quarter end, Loans to customers accounted for nearly three-quarters of Total assets.
Loans to customers increased by 176.6 million EUR, as we grew our lending to both Individuals and Businesses. Debt securities
grew by 165.5 million EUR, as we increased our investments in low-risk debt securities. Cash and central bank balances grew by
109.4 million EUR, which included 75 million EUR borrowed from the European Central Bank (ECB).
Deposits from customers increased by 255.7 million EUR. Within the net increase, deposits from Individuals fell by 186.6 million
EUR and deposits from Business customers reduced by 282.1 million EUR. These reductions were, however, offset by growth in
deposits from Public sector customers of 743.4 million EUR. Equity increased by just under 15 million EUR as we retained the
net profit generated in the period.
Given the heightened geopolitical risks, in the first quarter we issued and retained 750 million EUR of covered bonds. On 31
March 2022 our MREL-eligible securities were 29.66% of our total Risk Exposure Amounts and 14.61% of our leverage exposure,
as compared to our minimum requirement from 1 January 2022 of 26.92% and 5.91% respectively.

Leverage ratio, % 10.8 10.3 10.4
At the end of the first quarter, our own funds totalled 1,503.9 million EUR, composed entirely of Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1)
capital. Our CET1, Tier 1, and Total capital ratios increased in the quarter to 21.2%, as we added our audited net profits for 2021
to our capital base. This increase was offset in part by an increase in Risk Exposure Amounts (REA), which we measure on a
standardised basis, as we grew our credit portfolio. Retained net profit for the first quarter has not been included in the capital
calculation. Including the retained profit would increase the CET1 ratio to 21.4% at quarter end.
Our capital ratios remain well above our minimum capital requirements set by our regulators which, from 1 March 2022, require
us to have a CET1 ratio exceeding 10.24%, a Tier 1 ratio above 12.2% and a Total Capital ratio greater than 14.7%. These include
a Pillar 2 additional own funds requirement of 2.2%. We reviewed our capital requirements and concluded that, from 1 March
2022 our capital targets for CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital ratios will be 12.94%, 14.9% and 17.4% of REA respectively. These limits
include Pillar 2 guidance and management buffers. We continue to assess the value of Tier 2 capital to improve the efficiency
of our capital resources.
Our leverage ratio increased to 10.4% during the quarter as we included our audited net profits for 2021 to our capital base,
offset in part by the increase in total assets and off-balance sheet exposures.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio 197.3 137.3 136.6
Net Stable Funding Ratio 159.4 140.8 136.2
Our structural liquidity risk is conservative and well-balanced. It is based on metrics that measure liquidity risk and is
appropriately adapted to the current economic and regulatory environment. We use a range of metrics to measure liquidity
risk, one of which is the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). Our LCR fell marginally over the quarter to 136.6% as compared to a
minimum regulatory requirement of 100%. The liquidity buffer is composed of cash and liquid, central bank eligible, securities.
Long-term liquidity risk is measured by the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). On 31 March 2022 our NSFR was 136.2% compared
to 140.8% at end of the 2021, and a minimum regulatory requirement of 100%. The decrease of the ratio during the quarter was
driven by an increase in Required Stable Funding as we grew Loans to customers.

Non-performing loans ratio, % 3.1 1.8 1.7
The quality of our loan portfolio remains good and stable. While the threat from COVID-19 reduced through the quarter, the
economic impact of the invasion of Ukraine - including sanctions, disruption to supply chains, and inflation - and heightened
geopolitical risk means the outlook for loan losses remains uncertain. We revised our macroeconomic scenarios to reflect the
more challenging environment, which drove an increase in expected credit losses and hence allowances.
During February and March, we evaluated possible consequences from the invasion of Ukraine on our credit portfolio. Our
direct exposure to Russia, Belarus and Ukraine is insignificant. We have no direct exposure to companies domiciled in these
countries nor investments in the region. Our exposure to residents of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine is 0.02% of our total gross
lending and consists mostly of mortgage loans which are secured against residential real estate in the Baltics. Our counterparty
credit risk exposure is also insignificant.
In our evaluation, we assessed corporate customers’ ownership structures, together with corporate customers’ sales markets,
sourcing markets, location of production units and operations. We also assessed customers at risk from high and persistent
inflation, and customers for whom energy costs are significant. Corporate customers’ direct exposure to Russia, Belarus and
Ukraine is limited. We assessed that some 6% of our total gross lending is to corporate customers with some exposure to one
or more of the above mentioned risks. However, the number of our corporate customers with ownership links to the affected
region is limited; sales markets for most customers are diversified; and the risks related to the material sourcing and location
of production units and operations are mitigated in most cases.
We have identified an insignificant number of new non-performing exposures so far. That said, we have taken a prudent
approach to managing our risk exposures. During the quarter we placed on watch list those exposures we believe could be
impacted by higher geopolitical risks or high inflation, or exposures for whom energy costs are significant, and have classified
these exposures as stage 2. As a consequence, together with our incorporation of an additional top-down collective Significant
Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) adjustment for customers affected by the above mentioned risks, stage 2 exposures increased by
567 million EUR.
Total non-performing (‘stage 3’) loans decreased by 14.5 million to 171.1 million EUR, or 1.7% of gross lending, at the end of the
first quarter. The outflow of non-performing loans was around 1.6 times higher than the inflow, and this left the volume of non-
performing loans at its lowest level ever. The decrease was driven by repayments, collection activities including sales of
collateral, and cures resulting from the end of probation periods.
Of the 109.5 million EUR total allowances for expected credit losses on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter, 56.2 million
EUR were for Stage 3 exposures. The net carrying amount of Stage 3 loans was 114.9 million EUR against which we held collateral
with a fair value of 155.5 million EUR.
Details of the Credit loss allowance for the quarter of 11.4 million EUR can be found in the ‘Financial Performance’ section,
above.

1. Annual change
In 2021, the Baltic economies saw strong growth while unemployment fell to pre-COVID-19 levels. Wage growth remained high,
though real wages fell. This led to decreasing real purchasing power, but contributed to the competitiveness of firms and high
employment rates. Public debt remained low, leaving room for fiscal policy to operate effectively. The rise in the prices of
energy, metals and food, led to double digit inflation. Energy and food account for a higher proportion of consumer spending
in the Baltics than the EU average, which resulted in a strong pass-through of input prices to consumers. Inflation impacted the
balance sheets of lower income households, through rising utility costs, and those businesses who had contracted to supply
goods at fixed prices but had not hedged their input costs.
Forecasts for output growth for 2022 have fallen from some 4% at the start of the year to 1-2% now as export revenues fall,
commodity prices increase, and economic confidence drops. Luminor economists’ forecast double-digit inflation in 2022 as
firms pass-through higher input prices, with a decrease in rates after the summer. It is anticipated that wage growth will be
strong in nominal terms though, once again, lower than the growth in prices. Falling real wages are expected to keep
employment rates high. Governments are using their fiscal strength to support their economies, build defence capability, and
help refugees. Public debt is expected to remain at low levels as output growth continues and interest rates remain low. Further
ahead the Baltic economies will benefit from recovering consumer and investor confidence, and more stable commodity prices.
The exports of local goods and services to Russia have declined since 2014. In 2021 the share of exports of goods was around
1% of GDP and exports of services between 1.4% and 2.1% of GDP. In addition, there are some low value-added re-exports of
goods and services to Russia. Altogether the loss of export markets affects a very small share of Baltic companies. About half
of the imports from Russia in 2021 were energy products, which are now stopped or expected to cease in the near future. The
impact of this is expected to be manageable, with the procurement of energy from other sources, such as the opening of a new
LNG terminal in Estonia in 2022.
BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
In the first quarter we launched instant inward payments in Lithuania and will extend this to Estonia and Latvia during the year.
We continued to advance our work with Kyndryl to prepare for the launch of additional functionalities and products, and we
strengthened further our security and regulatory compliance processes. We also reviewed our cyber-security. In support of
our focus on ensuring IT stability while improving our services, products, and performance, we progressed our adoption of
ServiceNow and Amazon Cloud, and modernized our core banking platforms in Estonia and Latvia.
We continued to modernise our ATM network. Where ATM functionality permits, we have enabled contactless operations at
ATMs in Estonia and Latvia. These operations include contactless viewing of account balance information and withdrawal of
cash using both cards and wallets, and contactless cash depositing transactions with cards. We will continue our work to develop
our ATM network in the coming quarters.
In January we signed an agreement to acquire 99% of Maksekeskus, the leading e-commerce payment service provider in the
Baltic region. The acquisition will advance our digital transformation and strengthen our presence in the fast-growing e-
commerce payments market. The transaction, which was approved by the Estonian Competition Authority in March, is expected
to close in the coming months, and is subject to approval by the Estonian Financial Supervision and Resolution Authority.
Luminor Interim Report Q1 2022 13
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG)
During the quarter we refined our climate related data and data capabilities. We submitted to the ECB information about our
financed emissions and other climate risk factors in preparation for the ECB’s Climate Risk Stress Test later this year. To
enhance our evaluation of ESG risk during our credit risk assessment process, we drafted strategies for the manufacturing,
energy, construction, agriculture and retail trade sectors, all of which are exposed to high levels of climate risk. We continued
to reduce our carbon footprint and now use only Forest Stewardship Council certified or recycled paper in our offices, and
installed water dispensers in our headquarters.
To help to address the humanitarian impact of the invasion of Ukraine, we made it easier for citizens of the Ukraine to open an
account with us and we waived fees on all payments to accounts with Ukrainian banks. In addition, we donated 100,000 EUR to
MTÜ Pagulasabi, Gribu Palīdzēt Bēgļiem and Stiprus Kartu, three Baltic-based organisations who are assisting refugees.
We surveyed our staff to understand how they felt in the aftermath of the invasion. We used the insights gained from the Survey
to modify the content of our wellbeing programme with additional features on how to stay calm during uncertainty and how to
support other people. We also held an event for our leaders on how to support and lead teams during a crisis. In addition, we
established emotional support groups and offered individual psychological support.
Finally, we continued to promote financial literacy and support the societies we serve. Our employees gave guest lectures to
young people of different ages, and were given the opportunity to volunteer as mentors and guest teachers in schools. We also
donated computers we no longer require to schools in Estonia. In Estonia and Latvia, we announced a cooperation agreement
with social entrepreneurship development programmes.
PREVENTING FINANCIAL CRIME
We do not tolerate financial crime. We continued to improve our internal processes and rules during the first quarter, following
the plans we have submitted to our supervisors to raise further the effectiveness of our anti-money laundering work.
We have a low-risk appetite and a conservative business model. We operate only in the Baltic countries and target our products
and services at residents of the Baltic countries, and at individuals and companies with a strong connection to the Baltic
countries. During the quarter we enhanced our common monitoring and screening solution and continued to invest in our anti-
fraud framework and technology, while promoting ethical behaviour and building our risk culture.
We complied with new sanctions imposed by the European Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We added
capacity to fulfil our obligations under the new sanctions’ regime, and maintained close contact with relevant stakeholders.

Luminor Interim Report Q1 2022 19
NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Luminor Bank AS were prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim
Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not contain
all the information and disclosures required in the annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with Luminor
Bank AS annual financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021 (Annual Report 2021). The financial information in this
interim report is presented in the same format as in the Luminor Bank AS Annual Report 2021.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are
consistent with those followed in the preparation of the Luminor Bank AS Annual Report 2021, except for the adoption of new
standards effective as of 1 January 2022. Several amendments and interpretations are effective for the first time in 2022, but do
not have a material impact on the interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Luminor. Luminor has not early
adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS
Luminor makes estimates and applies assumptions that affect the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements
and the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continuously evaluated and are based on
management’s experience and expectations of future events. Consistent with Luminor Bank Annual Report 2021 the significant
estimates are the impairment of financial instruments, as well as the determination of the fair value.
Impairment of financial instruments
The methods and the key assumptions related to the calculation of the impairment of financial instruments are consistent with
those applied by Luminor for the year ended 31 December 2021 except as noted further. For more detailed information on the
impairment policies, please, refer to the Note 4 ‘General Risk Management Policies’ of the Luminor Bank Annual Report 2021.
The applied Expected Credit Loss (the ECL) model was enhanced during the first quarter of 2022 to reflect the effects of the
invasion of Ukraine. New collective Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) indicators were incorporated into the ECL model
due to different measures taken by governments and companies, such as sanctions and closure of operations. Consequently,
an additional collective impairment was established at the end of the quarter. Implementation of the new SICR indicators had
an impact on staging of credit exposures by increasing the amount of exposures classified within Stage 2, as well as by increasing
the total amount of impairment due to reclassification of exposures from Stage 1 to Stage 2. Consideration of the new SICR
indicators was based on the assessment of the impact of geopolitical risk, inflationary risk (including sustained energy price
increase) on credit customers, and on identification of customers with energy intensive operations. Thus, currently exposures
of customers that meet the new collective SICR indicators are treated at least as Stage 2 exposures.
A management overlay adjustment introduced in the fourth quarter of 2020 and applied during 2021 was also applied in the first
quarter of 2022 to adjust the standard ECL model output for the potential credit losses due to COVID-19 related uncertainties.
Fair value determination
The methods and the key assumptions related to the calculation of the fair value are consistent with those applied by Luminor
for the year ended 31 December 2021. When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded on the statement
of financial position cannot be derived from active markets, they are determined using a variety of valuation techniques that
include the use of mathematical models. The input to these models is taken from observable markets where possible, but where
this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. For the fair value of financial assets and liabilities,
please, refer to the Note 12.
20 Luminor Interim Report Q1 2022
2. GENERAL RISK MANAGEMENT POLICIES
CREDIT RISK
Impairment policies
Luminor recognises credit losses in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 9 applying a forward-looking ECL approach. For
more detailed information on the impairment policies, please, refer to the Note 4 ‘General Risk Management Policies’ of the
Luminor Bank Annual Report 2021. During the first quarter of 2022, the impairment calculation approach remained unchanged.
Projections of macroeconomic variables with probability weights over three years are prepared for each of the Baltic countries.
The most recent review of projections and assumptions of the macroeconomic variables was performed in the first quarter of
2022 to reflect mainly possible consequences of the invasion of Ukraine and to adjust the outlook due to COVID-19. The
probability weights for scenarios were also reviewed, which resulted in a change of probability weight of 20% (previously 10%)
probability for the optimistic scenario, 50% (previously 60%) for the baseline, and 30% for the pessimistic scenario. The
following tables show the parameters that were used for macroeconomic modelling.

1 Annual change
Given the uncertainty caused by COVID-19, Luminor decided to maintain in part a management overlay, although reduce the
overlay from 12 million EUR at the end of 2021 to 6 million EUR at the end of the first quarter of 2022. The reasons for the overlay
remain relevant, even though restrictions were lifted as the impact from the Omicron variant proved to be significantly less
severe compared to previous variants. Luminor’s decision to maintain in part the overlay was also supported by relative lack of
effective early indicators to predict credit quality developments, no clear trend of customers’ post grace period behaviour and
evolving inflation.
Luminor Interim Report Q1 2022 21
MARKET RISK
Luminor has a low appetite for market risk. The most significant parts of market risk for Luminor are interest rate risk and credit
spread risk. Both stayed well within internal limits during the first quarter of 2022 despite the changes in the outlook on interest
rates and the impacts of the invasion of Ukraine. Luminor has further increased its liquidity bond portfolio during the first
quarter to 715.4 million EUR by actively managing its liquidity buffer in accordance with internal procedures. The significance of
other risks is lower as Luminor does not have any open positions in equity instruments for trading, customer related foreign
exchange flow is managed through daily hedging activities, and all derivative contracts with customers are hedged with back-
to-back transactions.
LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is managed to ensure a constant ability to settle contractual obligations. Luminor’s liquidity position has remained
strong in the first quarter of 2022, with an LCR ratio standing at 136.6%. at quarter end. There were no external regulatory limit
breaches for Liquidity Risk during the first quarter of 2022.

2021 2022 2021
Net gain on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss 0.1 -0.1 0.3
Net gain (-loss) on debt securities designated at fair value through profit or loss -0.5 -6.8 -1.9

Net gain (-loss) from foreign currency operations -8.7 -1.7 -7.9
Total 4.6 5.1 20.9
The debt securities designated at fair value through profit or loss were negatively impacted by changes in underlying interest
rate curves. The portfolio has positive duration (close to 3 years) and therefore an increase in rates lowers the value of the
portfolio. The net loss from foreign currency operations reflects mainly the revaluation of foreign currency customer liabilities.
The net losses on debt securities designated at fair value through profit or loss and from foreign currency operations are offset
by the positive revaluation of derivatives, with which these assets and liabilities are hedged.

Hedge accounting
Luminor applies hedge accounting only to fair value hedges of issued debt securities. To test hedge effectiveness, Luminor uses
the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument against the changes
in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Ineffectiveness was clearly immaterial as at 31 March and 31
December 2021, and 31 March 2022. The carrying amount of the derivatives are included in line item ‘Derivative financial
instruments’ in the Balance Sheet, on either the Assets or Liabilities side depending on the fair value of the instruments. The
notional and fair value of hedging instruments are:

Notional amount 1,100.0 800.0 800.0
