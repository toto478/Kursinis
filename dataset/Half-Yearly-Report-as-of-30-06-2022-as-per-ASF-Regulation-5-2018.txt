In December 2021, the Management Board of BCR decided to declassifiy BCR Fleet Management from asset held for sale as the
criteria for classification under IFRS 5 was not longer met. On the declassification date, the asset was recognized at the lower of i)
its carrying amount prior to the asset or disposal group being classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation, amortisation
or revaluation that would have been recognized if the asset or disposal group had not been classified as held for sale and ii) its
recoverable amount at the date of the decision not to sell.
The difference between the recalculated value of the asset and its existing carrying amount is presented in the same income
statement caption used to present any gain or loss recognized on classification as held for sale (Other Operating Result).
As of December 2021, the Management Board of BCR Fleet Management has evaluated the overall situation of the company and
concluded that the appropriate approach is to prepare its financial statements for 2021 on a non-going concern basis because it
intends to cease concluding new lease contract and consequently to wind down the remaining portfolio. This evaluation remain
unchanged as of 30 June 2022.
Group structure has not changed since 31 December 2021.

2. Analysis of the issuer’s activity
2.1. Outlook on issuer’s activity
2022 economic outlook
Real GDP growth expected to slow down in 2022.
EU funds inflows are the economic growth key drivers as 70% of EU grants (up to EUR 79.9 bn in 2021-2027) frontloaded
in 2021-2022.
Average inflation rate anticipated to reach 12.4% in 2022 (5.05% inflation rate published for December 2021), following a
steep rise in commodities prices after Russia invaded Ukraine and high pressure on core inflation. Inflation could peak in
June and decline afterwards in December 2022.
Average unemployment rate is expected at 5.3% in 2022.
Real wage growth expected to be negative this year on the back of fast rise in inflation rate.
Significantly higher short-term interest rates, with higher average 3M ROBOR due to faster monetary tightening by the NBR.
Balance Sheet developments
Loan production will continue to be the key growth driver for the balance sheet, BCR Group expecting a high-single digit
growth in 2022, sustained by digital lending initiatives and state programs (i.e. IMM invest, PNRR program, Prima Casa).
Retail loans portfolio growth is assumed to moderate in 2022 mainly on the account of unsecured products. Retail lending
stock will register single-digit growth by end of 2022 mostly supported by robust growth in standard housing while Prima
Casa remains rather stable. At the same time, sound increase in Micro after full redesign of lending process and BCR Digital
Innovation.
Corporate is expected to see double-digit increase in lending portfolio, with positive developments in SME and LC segments.
On the liabilities side, deposits will continue their upward trend as a result of BCR's strategy to focus on increase the number
of active customers and on digitalization, supported by new George value proposition.
Income Statements developments
Operating income estimated to exceed the budgeted figure for the year end mainly on the back of net interest income due
to higher market rates environment and business volumes, net trading Q1-22 actual extraordinary result generated by current
geopolitical context, and higher rental income considering the postponement of Fleet Management portfolio sale.
Operating expenses expected to increase mainly driven by higher personnel expenses mostly generated by the inflationary
environment as well as higher regulatory costs.
Risk costs adjustment to new geopolitical context will bring additional allocations in 2022.
Based on improved operating performance, return on equity will continue to grow and is expected to reach a mid-double-
digit level.

2.2. Issuer’s tangible assets
Currently, the Bank has a portfolio of 82 properties, located in 39 counties, of which the largest number of buildings are in
Bucharest - 6 units, and the remaining 76 buildings are located in other counties in Romania.
In 2019, the Bank decided to pursue a strategy of optimizing the network of units and headquarter buildings including selling
certain properties. Implementation of strategy continued.
In 2021, the whole property portfolio was reassessed and, from the existing 14 properties previous classified under IFRS 5,
10 properties did not meet anymore the criteria to be classified under IFRS 5 and were reclassified to IAS 16. The main
driver for the reclassification was updating the Bank’s estimates regarding probability of executing the sale in the next 12
months.
During H1 2022, the Bank sold 5 properties (land and buildings), with a net book value of RON 11,000 thousand.
2.3. Issuer’s performance1
BCR Group achieved a net profit of RON 1,042.1 million (EUR 210.7 million) in H1 2022, up by 50.9% against RON
690.8 million (EUR 140.9 million) in H1 2021, driven by improved operating result underpinned by continued strong loan
growth.
Operating result improved by 25.2% to RON 1,268.1 million (EUR 256.4 million) in H1 2022 from RON 1,012.5 million
(EUR 206.6 million) in H1 2021, on the back of improved operating income, partly offset by higher operating expenses.
Net interest income increased by 13.9% to RON 1,362.5 million (EUR 275.5 million) in H1 2022, from RON 1,196 million
(EUR 244 million) in H1 2021, driven by higher business volumes in both retail and corporate coupled with higher market
rates.
Net fee and commission income increased by 17.6%, to RON 451.3 million (EUR 91.2 million) in H1 2022, from RON
383.8 million (EUR 78.3 million) in H1 2021, driven by higher fee income across all fee categories.
Net trading result increased by 73.8%, to RON 302.5 million (EUR 61.2 million) in H1 2022, from RON 174.1 million (EUR
35.5 million) in H1 2021, on higher trading activity.
Operating income increased by 19.6%, to RON 2,169.5 million (EUR 438.7 million) in H1 2022, from RON 1,814.3 million
(EUR 370.2 million) in H1 2021, driven by all major income components.
General administrative expenses reached RON 901.4 million (EUR 182.3 million) in H1 2022, up by 12.4% in
comparison to RON 801.8 million (EUR 163.6 million) in H1 2021, mainly due to higher contribution to deposit insurance
fund in 2022 and higher personnel expenses generated by the inflationary environment.
1 All the financial data presented below constitute the unaudited consolidated results of Banca Comercială Română (BCR) Group for H1 2022,
according to IFRS. Unless otherwise specified, the H1 2022 financial results are compared to the H1 2021 results. Also, unless otherwise
specified, the exchange rates used to convert amounts into euros are those communicated by the European Central Bank. The profit and loss
account is converted using the average exchange rate for H1 2022, i.e. 4.9458 RON/EUR when referring to the H1 2022 results, and using the
average exchange rate for H1 2021, i.e. 4.9015 RON/EUR with reference to the H1 2021 results. The balance sheets as of 30 June 2022 and
31 December 2021 are converted using the closing exchange rates on those dates (4.9464 RON/EUR on 30 June 2022, and 4.9490 RON/EUR
on 31 December 2021). All the percentage changes refer to the figures expressed in RON.

2.3. Issuer’s performance (continued)
As such, cost-income ratio improved to 41.5% in H1 2022, versus 44.2% in H1 2021.
Risk costs and Asset Quality
Impairment result from financial instruments recorded a provision allocation of RON 209.4 million (EUR 42.3 million)
in H1 2022, as compared to an allocation of RON 77.2 million (EUR 15.8 million) in H1 2021. This result has been mainly
influenced by the implementation of additional stricter rules for credit risk classification under IFRS 9 applied to clients from
industries potentially affected by the current operating environment and geopolitical context. Secondly, the risk parameters
have been updated to reflect the bank’s prudent approach on the current and expected evolution of the macroeconomic
environment.
NPL ratio reached 3.5% as of June 2022, lower than 3.9% recorded as of December 2021. This evolution is reflecting the
low NPL formation, a good trend of recoveries in both retail and corporate segments and also the increase in loans to
customers. At the same time, the NPL provisioning coverage stood at 149.5% as of June 2022.
Capital position and funding
Solvency ratio for BCR Bank standalone, according to the capital requirements regulations (CRR) stood at 19.1% as of
May 2022, well above the regulatory requirements of the National Bank of Romania. Furthermore, the Tier 1+2 capital ratio
of 20.4% (BCR Group, after profit capitalization) as of December 2021 is clearly reflecting BCR’s strong capital and
funding positions.
Net loans and advances to customers increased by 10% to RON 52,631.5 million (EUR 10,640.4 million) as of 30 June
2022 from RON 47,868.5 million (EUR 9,672.4 million) as of 31 December 2021, supported by increases in both retail loans
(+4.6% ytd to RON 28,188.2 million) and corporate loans (+15.6% ytd to RON 23,999.9 million).

from RON 72,458.4 million (EUR 14,641 million) as of 31 December 2021, due to slight decline in retail deposits (-3.8% ytd
to RON 44,422.5 million), while the corporate deposits remained flat (-0.1% ytd to RON 24,003.6 million).
