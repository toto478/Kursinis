BANCOLOMBIA S.A. (NYSE: CIB; BVC: BCOLOMBIA, PFBCOLOM) REPORTS FINANCIAL RESULTS FOR THE FIRST QUARTER
OF 2023.
• Net income attributable to shareholders of the parent company in 1Q23 was COP 1.7 trillion. This value represents an increase
of 4.5% compared to the previous quarter. Annualized return on equity (“ROE”) at the consolidated level was 17.7% for the
quarter and 19.0% for the last twelve months.
• Gross loans amount to COP 267 trillion, decreasing 1.0% compared to the last quarter of 2022. It is important to highlight the
3.4% appreciation of the Colombian Peso against the US dollar that impacted the loan balance. The operation in Colombia and
Banistmo in Panama were the main contributors for the credit portfolio contraction on a consolidated basis.
• 30-day past due loans stood at 4.25% and 90-day past due loans at 2.70%. Total provision charges, net for 1Q23 were COP 2,046
billion that represented an increase of 17.5% when compared to 4Q22, led by credit deterioration mainly in the consumer
portfolio.
• Shareholders’ equity attributable to the owners of the parent company stood at COP 36.9 trillion as of March 31, 2023,
decreasing 5.6% compared to the previous quarter. This variation is largely explained by the distribution of profits declared at
the shareholders' meeting corresponding to 2022 results. Basic solvency stood at 9.75% and the total consolidated solvency ratio
was 12.01% for 1Q23, complying with the minimum regulatory requirements.
• In reference to its digital strategy, Bancolombia maintains an encouraging growth trend. As of March 2023, the bank has 7.8
million active digital customers in the Retail APP (over a period of three months), as well as 22.2 million accounts in its financial
inclusion platforms (6.6 million users in Bancolombia a la Mano and 15.6 million in NEQUI).

1.21.. Assets
3.
As of March 31, 2023, Bancolombia's assets at the consolidated level totaled COP 349,323 billion, which represents a
decrease of 1.0% compared to 4Q22 and an increase of 19.9% compared to 1Q22. The variation in total assets during the
last year is largely explained by loan book growth.
During the quarter, the peso appreciated 3.4% against the US dollar and depreciated 23.7% in the last 12 months. The
average exchange rate was 11.8% higher in 1Q23 versus 4Q22, and 21.6% higher in the last 12 months.
1.2. Loan Portfolio
The following table shows the composition of Bancolombia loans on a consolidated basis by type and currency:
(COP Million) Amounts in COP Amounts in USD converted to COP Amounts in USD (thousands) Total
(1 USD = 4646,08 COP) 1Q23 1Q23 / 4Q22 1Q23 1Q23 / 4Q22 1Q23 1Q23 / 4Q22 1Q23 1Q23 / 4Q22

Mortgage loans 19,874,148 1.46% 17,387,173 -2.23% 3,742,332 1.22% 37,261,321 -0.29%
Small business loans 556,634 -2.82% 7 23,718 -4.26% 155,770 -0.88% 1,280,352 -3.64%
Interests paid in advance ( 16,670) -7.52% (993) -21.21% (214) -18.43% (17,663) -8.41%
Gross loans 169,162,272 -0.06% 98,106,843 -2.53% 21,116,047 0.91% 267,269,115 -0.98%
In 1Q23, gross loans declined 1.0% compared to 4Q22 (increasing 0.3% when excluding the FX effect) and rose 20.1%
compared to 1Q22. During the last 12 months peso-denominated loans grew 14.0% and the dollar-denominated loans
(expressed in USD) grew 7.0%.
At the end of 1Q23, Banco Agricola operations in El Salvador, Banistmo in Panama and BAM in Guatemala represented 28.7%
of total gross loans. Gross loans denominated in currencies other than COP, generated by operations in Central America,
the international operation of Bancolombia Panamá, Puerto Rico and the USD denominated loans in Colombia, accounted
for 36.7% of the portfolio, and decreased 0.9% in the quarter (when expressed in COP).
Total reserves (provisions in the balance sheet) for loan losses increased 6.7% during the quarter and totaled COP 16,513
billion or 6.2% of the gross loans at the end of the quarter.
During 1Q23, for the first time since 2020 the credit portfolio experienced a quarterly contraction. Such decrease is partially
explained by the Colombian peso appreciation that impacted the balance on foreign subsidiaries. The largest decrease took
place in the commercial portfolio both in absolute value and in percentage change (-1.2%). On consumer, the loan reduction
was led by Bancolombia S.A. in line with the strong pick-up in interest rates and the lower credit demand, which was reflected
in the decline of personal loans and credit card balances.
Banco Agromercantil recorded a quarterly growth of 2.6% when calculated in USD and is the only operation with an
expansion across all loan categories. The best performance on originations involves consumer with a positive growth of 5.9%
driven largely by credit cards.
Banco Agricola reports a 0.7% growth when calculated in USD during the quarter, following the last quarters´ deceleration
trend. Consumer loans expanded 1.1% as the segment with the best performance, highlighting personal loans with an
important improvement in originations during 1Q23.
Banistmo recorded a 1.1% decrease calculated in USD during the quarter. Commercial loans contracted 2.6% mainly
explained by significant prepayments from corporate clients.

1.3. Investment Portfolio
As of March 31, 2023, Bancolombia net investment portfolio at the consolidated level totaled COP 30,969 billion, increasing
10.8% from the end of 4Q22 and 13.4% from the end of 1Q22. Such growth was a deliberate strategy to allocate resources
in the market intended to optimize the asset balance. At the end of 1Q23, the debt securities portfolio had a duration of
13.7 months and a weighted average yield to maturity of 10.0%.
1.4. Goodwill and intangibles
At the end of 1Q23, Bancolombia's goodwill and intangibles at the consolidated level totaled COP 10,093 billion, down 3.3%
compared to 4Q22. This quarterly variation is mainly explained by the appreciation of the COP against the USD.
1.5. Funding
As of March 31, 2023, Bancolombia's liabilities at the consolidated level totaled COP 311,469 billion, decreasing 0.4% from
the end of 4Q22, and increasing 20.0% compared to 1Q22.
Customer deposits totaled COP 251,007 billion (80.6% of liabilities) at the end of 1Q23, up 0.01% compared to 4Q22 and up
20.4% over the last 12 months. The net loans to deposits ratio was 99.9% at the end of 1Q23 decreasing compared to 101.4%
in 4Q22, driven by the credit portfolio contraction.
Certificates of deposit increased by 11.9% during 1Q23, following the growing trend seen since the first quarter of 2022.
This performance is explained to a greater extent by the operation in Colombia and represents a significant variation in the
funding mix on a consolidated basis, going from a 30% share in 4Q22 to 34% in 1Q23. The new funding composition is
explained by the higher interest rates environment and the clients´ demand for more profitable products. The appreciation
of the peso against the dollar affected the amount of long-term debt and loans with banks due to the balance of foreign
subsidiaries.

Shareholders’ equity attributable to the owners of the parent company at the end of 1Q23 was COP 36,918 billion,
decreasing by 5.6% compared to 4Q22 and increasing by 22.2% when compared to 1Q22. In March of 2023 the General
Shareholders’ Meeting approved the proposal for distribution of profits for a total of COP 3.4 trillion. Dividends approved
mainly explain the quarterly reduction in equity and capital ratio.

1Q 23
Bancolombia solvency ratio on a consolidated basis under Basel III was 12.01% in 1Q23 standing 113 basis points above the
minimum level required by the regulator in Colombia, while the basic capital ratio (Tier 1) stood at 9.75%, 225 basis points
above the minimum regulatory capital level (value to fully comply with the new capital requirements in the third year of the
Basel III phase-in period). The tangible capital ratio, defined as shareholders’ equity minus goodwill and intangible assets
divided by tangible assets, was 7.72% at the end of 1Q23.
(1) Technical capital is the sum of basic and additional capital, minus deductions ($16,136MM for 4Q22and $15,184MM for 1Q23).
(2) Operational risk applies to 1Q22, 4Q22 and 1Q23 after the adoption of Basel III regulation.
(3) Capital adequacy is technical capital divided by risk-weighted assets.
2. INCO ME STATEMENT
2.
Net income attributable to equity holders of the parent company was COP 1,717 billion in 1Q23, or COP 1,784.91 per share
(USD $ 1.54 per ADR). This profit represents an increase of 4.5% compared to 4Q22. The company´s annualized return on
equity (“ROE”) was 17.7% for 1Q23 and 19.0% for the last 12 months.
2.1. Net Interest Income
Net interest income totaled COP 5,358 billion in 1Q23, 0.1% higher than the income reported in 4Q22, and 44.8% above
1Q22. The lower expansion in the quarter for the net balance compared to recent periods reflects the gradual impact that
has been taking place due to the increase in interest expenses following the greater volume in time deposits and the greater
expense by higher rates in the different funding products. On the other hand, the investment portfolio interest income
amounted COP 442 billion in 1Q23 with a decrease of 25.9% compared to 4Q22 and an increase of 127.1% compared to
1Q22.
Net Interest Margin
The annualized net interest margin decreased to 7.2% during 1Q23. The annualized net interest margin for investments in
1Q23 was 2.0%. The good performance in this line is explained in the first quarter by the appreciation on the investment
portfolio due to an efficient allocation of resources in the fixed income market and an orderly management with clients for
the distribution of financial instruments in an environment of volatility, both in currencies and interest rates.
The annualized net interest margin of the loan portfolio was 7.9%, presenting an increase of 28 basis points when compared
to 4Q22 and 121 basis point when compared to 1Q22. This result follows the growing trend seen during the last five quarters
as an effect of the credit portfolio repricing originated by the Colombian Central Bank contractionary monetary policy still
in force during 1Q23.
(1) Net interest margin and valuation income on financial instruments.
The aggregate balance of savings accounts and checking accounts decreased on a quarterly basis, although presented an
increase in the year. Savings accounts went down 6.3% compared to 4Q22 and increased 5.4% compared to 1Q22. On the
other hand, checking accounts decreased 7.0% compared to 4Q22 and 4.0% compared to 1Q22. The annualized weighted
average cost of deposits was 5.14% in 1Q23, increasing 112 basis points compared to 4Q22 and 359 basis points compared

The total cost of financing for 1Q23 confirms an increasing trend that began in the last quarter of 2021. The rearrangement
of the funding mix that intensified in 2023 with a greater weight from term deposits, in the midst of an environment of
higher interest rates interest, explain the gradually higher expenses. It is worth mentioning the bank's sound stable funding
profile, fully complying with regulatory requirements. Also, a favorable result is the significant share of savings accounts
and checking accounts within the bank's liability structure, both adding up to more than 51% of the funds, and thus,
contributing to an efficient total cost.
2.2. Fees and Income from Services
During 1Q23, total fees and commissions, net totaled COP 1,002 billion, down 1.9% compared to 4Q22, and up 9.0%
compared to 1Q22.
Credit and debit card fees and commercial establishments reveals a reduction in the quarterly balance, provided the
seasonality condition and the higher income collected in the last quarter of each year. Conversely, in the annual
performance, a significant growth took place mainly due to higher income from intermediary bank fees, caused by the high
volume of transactions carried out through traditional merchant businesses and e-commerce, resulting in a positive net
balance despite the increases in expenses due, to a greater extent, to franchise processing.
Income from bancassurance increased 27.0% when compared to 1Q22 explained by a greater balance on distributed
insurance policies.
Banking services grew 27.3% in the year, on the back of a greater demand for transactional products and greater use of
network channels. On payments, the higher income was driven by the incremental collection from individual clients.
2.3. Other Operating Income
Total other operating income was COP 990 billion in 1Q23, up by 84.2% compared to 4Q22 and by 51.4% compared to 1Q22.
The quarterly expansion is mainly explained by income generated from net foreign exchange associated to hedging
operations on investments.
Income from operating leases was COP 418 billion in 1Q23, an increase of 7.6% compared to 4Q22 and 40.5% compared to
1Q22. The annual growth is explained to a greater extent by the operation in Colombia due to the increase in vehicle rental
contracts under lease agreements and a greater volume in real estate leasing operations from the Colombian Real Estate
Fund “FIC”. Profit from sale of assets was COP 48 billion, higher by 25.6% compared to 1Q22 due to a greater volume of
operations.
2.4. Asset Quality, Provision Charges and Balance Sheet Strength
The principal balance for past due loans (those that are overdue for more than 30 days) totaled COP 11,045 billion at the
end of 1Q23 and represents 4.3% of total gross loans, increasing when compared to 4Q22, when past due loans represented
3.2% of total gross loans. During the quarter, charge-offs totaled COP 1,048 billion.

1Q 23
The coverage, measured by the ratio of allowances for loans losses (principal) to PDLs (overdue 30 days), was 138.3% at the
end of 1Q23, decreasing compared to 168.7% at the end of 4Q22. The deterioration of the loan portfolio (new past due loans
including charge-offs) was COP 3,603 billion.
Provision charges (net of recoveries) totaled COP 2,046 billion in 1Q23, presenting a 17.5% growth compared to 4Q22.
Following the previous quarter trend, in 1Q23 most of the amount in provision expenses was concentrated in the Colombian
operation in line with a greater portfolio deterioration on consumer loans.
Provisions as a percentage of the average gross loans were 3.1% annualized for 1Q23 and 2.2% for the last 12 months.
Bancolombia maintains a strong balance sheet supported by an adequate level of loan loss reserves. Allowances (for the
principal) for loan losses totaled COP 15,274 billion, or 5.9% of total loans at the end of 1Q23, increasing when compared to
4Q22.
The following tables present key metrics related to asset quality:
(1) Allowances are reserves for the principal of loans.
* Mortgage loans that were overdue were calculated for past due loans for 120 days instead of 90 days.
Stage 1. Financial instruments that do not deteriorate since their initial recognition or that have low credit risk at the end of the reporting period. (12-month expected credit losses).
Stage 2. Financial instruments that have significantly increased their risk since their initial recognition. (Lifetime expected credit losses).
Stage 3. Financial instruments that have Objective Evidence of Impairment in the reported period. (Lifetime expected credit losses).
2.5. Operating Expenses
During 1Q23, operating expenses totaled COP 3,072 billion, decreasing by 4.6% compared to 4Q22 and increasing by 26.0%
compared to 1Q22.

1Q 23
Personnel expenses (salaries, bonus plan payments and compensation) totaled COP 1,323 billion in 1Q23, up 11.6% from
4Q22 and up 23.9% from 1Q22. The annual variation is mainly explained by salary increases indexed to inflation, as well as
variable compensation provisions.
General expenses decreased 14.0% in the quarter and increased 27.6% year-over-year. The variation in annual terms is
affected by external factors such as the depreciation of the Colombian peso against the US dollar, inflation rates and higher
taxes other than income tax approved in the last tax reform in Colombia. Internally, the main factors that contributed to
growth were technology expenses such as hardware modernization and the journey to the cloud project as part of the digital
transformation, as well as the customer rental contracts division (Renting) due to the increase in the active fleet of vehicles.
As of March 31, 2023, Bancolombia had 33,923 employees, owned 872 branches, 6,132 ATMs, 29,443 banking agents and
served more than 29 million customers.
2.6. Taxes
Bancolombia's consolidated income tax for 1Q23 presented an expense of COP 586 billion, mainly impacted by Colombia
due to the application of tax benefits such as untaxed dividends, exempt income and investment in productive real fixed
assets. Additionally, due to the tax benefits in Guatemala, El Salvador and Panama, corresponding to exempt revenue from
returns on securities issued by their governments. Revenues from foreign sources that are not taxed in Panama also
contributed to a lower tax.

3. BRE AKDOWN OF OPERATIONS
The following tables summarize the financial statements of our operations in each country.
BANCOLOMBIA S.A. (STAND ALONE) - COLOMBIA
The portfolio of Bancolombia S.A. presents a decrease of 0.4% in the quarter and an increase of 14.7% in the last 12 months.
The slowdown seen since the end of 2022 has continued at the beginning of 2023 following a slower growth rate in the
economy, a gradual increase in interest rates and its impact on the payment capacity of companies and individuals. The only
segment that presented expansion during the quarter was mortgages, growing 1.5%. The commercial portfolio presented
the largest contraction (0.7%) to a greater extent associated to Factoring loans. On the other hand, consumer presented a
decrease of 0.4% affected by personal loans and credit card balances.
Net result for Bancolombia S.A. in 1Q23 was COP 1.7 trillion, which represents an increase of 5.2% when compared to the
result of 4Q22. Net interest shows a reduction due to a greater increase on interest expenses vs interest income, this effect
was caused by a greater volume in term deposits and higher deposit rates. Provision expenses show a quarterly growth of
21.1%, influenced by deterioration in consumer, and expenses associated to macroeconomic variables. Net feese decreased
in 1Q23 due to lower revenues in transactional products as a seasonal effect of the last quarter of the year compared to the
first quarter. Other operating income grew mainly by equity method from foreign subsidiaries in the quarter. Operating
expenses recorded a 6.8% decrease compared to 4Q22, largely due to general expenses, such as fees and advertising.

1Q 23
BANISTMO- PANAMA
Banistmo's portfolio closed 1Q23 with a decrease of 1.1% compared to the previous quarter (calculated in USD). Commercial
presented the largest contraction as a result of prepayments from the corporate sector in January. Similarly, the consumer
and microlending portfolios show a reduction, while mortgages grew 0.7% concentrated in the social housing portfolio. In
the funding structure, it is worth noting a decrease on deposit products impacted by highly competitive interest rates in the
market.
Net result for Banistmo in 1Q23 was a profit of COP 170.0 billion, which represents a significant growth in annual and
quarterly terms. Despite the net interest income reduction in the quarter and the lower portfolio balance, Banistmo
maintains a relatively stable net interest margin due to the positive repricing on loans, mainly in commercial. The net income
expansion is mainly explained by lower loan provision expenses, due to parameters update over the expected losses model
and a lower deterioration in the credit portfolio. Operating expenses also decreased largely due to the last quarter of the
year seasonal effect, when usually there is an accrual accounting in some services and specific payments. Net interest margin
in Banistmo for 1Q23 was 3.9% and annualized quarterly ROE was 12.7%.

1Q 23
BANAGRICOLA- EL SALVADOR
Loans in Banco Agricola grew 0.7% in the quarter (calculated in USD). The consumer portfolio presented the highest growth
(1.1%) driven by personal loans and credit cards. Commercial increased 0.8%, in which construction clients had an important
contribution on originations. In general, commercial loans show a slowdown compared to recent quarters when they used
to expand at a higher rate. In the funding structure, it is worth noting the significant growth in deposits led by checking
accounts, which increased by 15.6%, mainly driven by deposits on institutional, government and corporate segments. This
increase favorably offsets the reduction in savings account balances (-2.2%). Time deposits remain relatively stable.
Net result for Banco Agricola in 1Q23 was a profit of COP 134.5 billion, which represents an increase of 11.1% compared to
4Q22. Net interest income shows a quarterly reduction mainly due to growth in interest expenses from loans with financial
institutions, to a greater extent caused by an interest rate increase on medium-term loans. It was partially offset by growing
revenues from the lending business. Loan provisions increased in the quarter due to a greater deterioration reflected in the
stage 3 balance rise. Operating expenses recorded a quarterly reduction resulting from a lower balance on amortization and
intangibles due to the early cancellation of projects at the end of December 2022. The accumulated effective tax rate for
Banco Agricola was 26%, positively impacted by exempt revenues from return on investments issued by the Government of
El Salvador and by exempt dividends. Banco Agrícola's net interest margin for 1Q23 was 6.2% and the annualized quarterly
ROE was 19.9%.

1Q 23
GRUPO AGROMERCANTIL HOLDING – GUATEMALA
The credit portfolio in BAM continues in 1Q23 the positive trend of 2022, closing with a quarterly growth of 2.6% (calculated
in USD). The fastest growing segment continues to be consumer, in which the largest originations involved credit cards.
Commercial loans also reflect a good trend, although to a lesser extent, with significant originations completed in February.
In the funding structure, there has been an increase in deposits in line with the loan portfolio growth. Both in savings
accounts, checking accounts and term deposits, the deposit taking activity was concentrated in corporates during 1Q23. In
addition, new lines of credit with financial institutions were approved to complement the resources needed to support the
lending business.
The net result for BAM in 1Q23 was a profit of COP 66.5 billion. Net interest income grew in the quarter following the good
performance in loans and the increase in interest rates. The main impact in the net income contraction during the quarter is
explained by provision expenses linked to deterioration in consumer. On the other hand, operating expenses declined thanks
to a greater efficiency in technology, as well as lower marketing expenses and fees. BAM's net interest margin for 1Q23 was
5.9% and annualized quarterly ROE was 11.1%.
