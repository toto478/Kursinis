Management report
The Group’s type of operations
Storent Holdings SIA (hereinafter – the Group’s Parent company or Storent Holdings) was established on 11 October 2018. On 28
December 2022, Storent Holdings acquired all shares of Storent Investments AS and SEL Investments SIA (hereinafter – the Group).
Given the sizes and business specifics of the Group components, the Group accounts for these business combinations as reverse
acquisition – Storent Holdings (the legal acquirer) is identified as the accounting acquiree and Storent Investments AS (the legal acquiree)
is identified as the accounting acquirer. As a result, from the point of view of the combined entity (the Group), the acquisition of SEL
Investments SIA and Storent Holdings are accounted for using the acquisition method. The first company of the Group - Storent SIA - was
established in 2008 by Andris Bisnieks and Andris Pavlovs with the objective of becoming one of the leading equipment rental companies
in the Baltics and nearest European countries. In the end of 2022 the Group’s management have decided to sell the subsidiary in Russia
(Kaliningrad) and currently it is in the process of legal formalities. The structure of the newly created group of companies is as follows:
The Group’s objective is to provide customers with rental equipment solutions utilizing modern digital tools, team expertise and providing
excellent service. Online sales channel with advanced IT solutions ensures fast, convenient and contactless rental process with
competitive pricing.
Development of the Group and results of financial operations in the reporting year
As these consolidated financial statements have been prepared applying the reverse acquisition as a continuation of the amounts
previously presented in the consolidated financial statements of Storent Investments AS, the consolidated results of the Group for 2022
include the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of the the legal acquiree (identified as the accounting acquirer) Storent
Investments AS for the full reporting period and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income of accounting acquirees Storent
Holdings SIA and SEL Investments SIA and its subsidiaries SELECTIA SIA and SELECTIA PLUS SIA from the date of their acquisition
and up to the end of the reporting period.
Storent Investments AS and its subsidiaries in addition to a modern rental fleet and a large rental depo network have a wide customer
base with a very well-developed trademark, experienced team and digital know-how. SEL Investments SIA and its two subsidiaries own
around 50% of the construction equipment fleet that Storent group operates. The merger of both groups will allows to increase expertise
and improve financial ratios to continue the development of the Group with a significantly higher speed and profitability.
Despite the unstable geopolitical situation in 2022, the Group managed to slightly improve its consolidated performance indicators. Net
revenue increased by 3% and total revenue (including other operating income) by 8%, as well as it was possible to reduce the negative
net result (before the effect of the gain on bargain purchase) by almost one million euros and concluded financial year with positive net
result of 4.8 million euro. The Group management worked on efficiency increase by reducing headcount during 2022 by 18 people, as well
as realized savings on other expenses positions during the financial year. Construction markets increased in all countries where Storent
operates. Although rental market still faces strong price competition and rental equipment overcapacity, rental prices started to rise slowly
mainly due to the high inflation level.

The Group’s consolidated balance sheet has a stable structure consisting of 45% shareholders equity, 18% long term liabilities and 37%
short term liabilities. Non-current assets constitute 80% of the total assets. The Group’s business peculiarity historically was always having
a working capital deficit due to large amount of liabilities to finance investments in rental equipment; however, this has not prevented the
Group from meeting its obligations in accordance with their terms. Almost 700 thousand euros Group’s total bank account balance at the
end of the reporting period is sufficient to ensure the Group’s operational activities. Following table shows main historical and planned

Baltic region rental operations increased by 3.5% with two digits number increase rate in Latvia, smaller increase in Estonia and minor
decrease in Lithuania. The Baltic region accounts for approximately 70% of the Group’s net revenue. In 2022, the growth of construction
market in Estonia was almost 17%. The market growth is expected to be modest in 2023, while various construction projects will continue
during the year, such as Rail Baltica and its adjacent infrastructure. In 2022, the Latvian construction market increased by 7%. In 2023,
several large and medium-scale projects are planned, some of which will be implemented within the framework of EU programs and also
Rail Baltica project has significant impact on construction market activity. In 2022, the Lithuanian construction market continued to grow,
reaching 24% increase. There was an increase in all segments of construction. In 2023, the Rail Baltica project will continue, which will
provide additional demand for rental equipment throughout the Baltics, and gives the management additional confidence for 2023.
Construction market volume historical data and forecast doesn’t always reflect the construction rental market potential. It depends on the
construction project types and stages at the exact year. The Group’s entities growth possibilities are higher in the markets, where Storent
has smaller share of the market. It’s expected that the lack of construction workforce and higher personnel costs will increase prices and
demand of rental construction equipment as construction companies will look for ways how to replace manual work with increased use of
tools and equipment.

Nordic operations increased by 2% in 2022 compared to 2021 with similar grow rate in both countries. Constructions market showed also
a small increase, that allowed also to increase rental prices. In spring 2022 Finnish entity sold its transportation department and now is
using it as an outsourced service. That allows to focus on rental operations’ profitability. Swedish operations were stable and more
customers started to come from outside Stockholm area. Forecast for 2023 for construction market in Nordic countries is with small
decrease, Storent market share is very small in these countries so it should not affect sales results.
Operations of subsidiary Storent OOO in Kaliningrad have seen a significant revenue increase, reaching 48% increase compared to
2021. At the end of 2022, the Group’s management decided to sell the subsidiary in Russia (Kaliningrad) and, currently, is in the process
of legal formalities. The Group monitors and follows sanction restrictions, and so far, they don’t affect subsidiary’s activities.
In 2022, the Group continued cooperation with split-rent and re-rent platform PreferRent. In early 2022, Storent entities in the Baltics joined
online logistics platform Cargopoint that allows to organize transportation in a more efficient manner and gives opportunity to serve a wider
range of customers with a more competitive price. Storent Group continued to develop and invest in IT technologies. In December 2022,
implementation of new IT system was started, and it is expected that IRMS (Intelligent Rental Management System) will be implemented
in all Storent group companies by the end of 2023. It will allow to improve efficiency and ensure convenient and up-to-date rental process.
A flexible approach to rental fleet rotation among Storent Group companies ensured a quicker response to construction market changes
and, overall, a more efficient rental fleet usage. In 2022, Storent Investments AS continued to develop online rental service. Online ordering
is a stable sales channel and it makes up to 50% of the total income of Storent in the Baltic states for the year 2022. Historically, the
highest numbers have been reached for digital authorisations and electronically signed documents of 90% of all rental deliveries.
The future development of the Group
The Group management plans further development of subsidiaries in five countries as a part of Storent Holdings group.
In 2023, Storent group will continue to focus on an improvement of sales process efficiency, additions to and renewal of rental fleet, as
well as develop online sales and digitalization. The management of the Group expects that the rental revenues will increase by 10%, which
will be facilitated by new investments in rental equipment, increase of rental prices and online sales. In the summer of 2023, it is planned
to introduce a new website that will be more convenient for the end user. The goal of Storent group is to keep the volume of online orders
close to 60% of the total rental income and 90% digitally signed transactions. The Group will continue to transform its IT strategy to comply
with the scalability needs and it is planned to complete the implementation of the new cloud-based ERP system by the end of 2023.
Please see Note 36 for the management consideration of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern ..
Financial risk management
The Group’s key principles of financial risk management are laid out in Note 33.
Conditions and events after the end of the reporting year
In April 2023, Storent Holdings SIA announced a new bond issue of up to EUR 15 million, which will, for the first time, be open to both
retail and institutional investors. The Group will use the proceeds for new investments, further mergers and acquisition and to refinance
its liabilities.
After the year end, the Group has started the legal reorganization process, which was approved in the end of 2022, to complete the
merger of its subsidiaries – SEL Investments SIA with Storent Investments AS and Selectia SIA, Selectia Plus with Storent SIA – by the
end of 2023, which will save administrative costs, excluding mutual transactions and the costs associated with their accounting and
simplifying internal processes in the subsidiary entities. Since January 2023, all equipment is leased between the Group’s subsidiary
companies without the intermediary of the PreferRent platform, which creates savings for the Group.
As of the last day of the reporting year until the date of signing these consolidated financial statements, there have been no other events
requiring adjustment of or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(b) Consolidation (cont.)
The separate financial statements of the subsidiaries have been consolidated into the Group’s consolidated financial
statements, consolidating the respective assets, liabilities, revenue and expense items. The subsidiaries controlled by the
Group’s Parent company are included in the consolidation. Control is achieved when the Group:
• has power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to
one or more of the three elements of control listed above.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses
control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are
included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and other comprehensive income from the date the Group
Parent company gains control until the date when the Group Parent company ceases to control the subsidiary. The Group
Parent company’s and its subsidiaries’ financial years are equal and represent the calendar year. For the purposes of
preparing the consolidated financial statements uniform accounting policies have been applied.
The consolidated financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, gains, losses and cash flows of Storent
Holdings SIA and its subsidiaries Storent Investments AS, Storent SIA, Storent UAB, Storent OÜ, Storent Holding Finland
Oy, Storent AB, Storent AS, Storent OOO, Storent Oy, SEL Investments SIA, SELECTIA SIA and SELECTIA PLUS SIA in
the manner as if Storent Holdings SIA and its subsidiaries were a single entity.
Upon consolidation inter-company unrealized profit, inter-company transactions, balances, inter-company interest in entities
and other transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as
unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Please refer to Note 35 for further details regarding the accounting for business combinations.
(c) Foreign currency transactions
The monetary unit used in the consolidated financial statements is the official currency of the European Union – euro (EUR),
which is Group’s Parent company’s and some of the subsidiaries functional and presentation currency. The functional currency
of Storent AS is Norwegian krone, of Storent AB is Swedish krone and of Storent OOO is Russian ruble.
All transactions in foreign currency are converted to EUR based on the European Central Bank reference exchange rate on
trade date. On the balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the European Central
Bank reference exchange rate as at 31 December.
European Central Bank reference exchange rates:
31.12.2022 31.12.2021
EUR EUR
1 USD 0.93755 0.88292
1 GBP 1.12748 1.19007
1 NOK 0.09511 0.10011
1 SEK 0.08991 0.09755
1 RUB 0.0127* 0.01172
* Due to geopolitical situation, the last time RUB exchange rate has been published by ECB is on 1 March 2022. In order to
provide users of these financial statements with more accurate information, the Group management decided to use the
following rates for RUB transactions: for period 1 January 2022 till 1 March 2022 the ECB published rate has been used, while
starting from 2 March 2022 and till the end of the reporting period the estimated market rate has been used, which is based
on the exchange rates offered by major financial market platforms, which are providing real-time data (www.investing.com).
Profit or loss from exchange rate differences, as well as from the foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities denominated
in euro, are recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
(d) Consolidation of foreign subsidiaries
Consolidating foreign subsidiaries into the consolidated financial statement, the Group’s Parent company translated the
monetary and non-monetary assets and liabilities at the European Central Bank reference exchange rate ruling at the closing
balance sheet date, and revenue and expense items of the foreign subsidiaries at the reference exchange rates at the dates
of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on recognizing asset and liability items, translating at exchange rates, are
recognized in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(e) Use of judgements, estimates and assumptions
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements according to the IFRS requires the Group’s management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. The determination of estimates is based on comprehensive information, current and expected economic conditions
available to the management. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The following are the critical judgments and key estimates concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation
uncertainty, which exist at the reporting date of the financial statements that have a significant risk of causing a material
adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities during the next reporting period:
Note 35 - Identification of the acquirer and Assessment whether business was acquired
On 28 December 2022, Storent Holdings SIA, the legal acquirer, acquired Storent Investments AS, the legal acquiree, by way
of issuing its equity instruments to the shareholders of Storent Investments AS as the full amount of consideration transferred.
On identification of the acquirer in the business combination, the management considered the following factors:
- Storent Investments AS is a business as per IFRS 3 requirements;
- Storent Holdings SIA before the acquisition had limited operations, and Storent Investments AS (consolidated) was
significantly larger than Storent Holdings SIA in terms of assets and revenues;
- Based on the amount of equity instruments issued to effect the acquisition, Storent Investments AS previous
shareholders obtained the majority of voting interest in Storent Holdings SIA post-acquisition.
Based on the above, the management assessed that this business combination has to be accounted for as a reverse
acquisition, and Storent Holdings SIA consolidated financial statements to be prepared as a continuation of Storent
Investments AS consolidated financial statements.
SEL Investments SIA and its subsidiaries SELECTIA SIA and SELECTIA PLUS SIA own around 50% of the construction equipment
fleet that Storent Investments AS group operates and have limited other clients. SEL Investments subgroup has been determined
to have an integrated set of activities and assets, including relevant inputs and processes that are applied to those inputs, to be
considered a business as per IFRS 3 requirements.
Note 12 – Recoverable value of goodwill and other non-current non-financial assets;
The Group’s management reviews the carrying amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill, and property, plant and equipment,
and assesses whether indications exist that the assets’ recoverable amounts are lower than their carrying amounts. The Group’s
management calculates and records an impairment loss on intangible assets and fixed assets based on the estimates related to the
expected future use, planned liquidation or sale of the assets. Taking into consideration the Group’s planned level of activities and
the estimated value in use of the assets (including the intended restructuring within Storent Holdings group), the Group’s
management considers that no significant adjustments to the carrying values of intangible assets and fixed assets are necessary as
of 31 December 2022.
Note 16 – Fair value less costs to sell of disposal group held for sale
The disposal group that are classified as held for sale has to be measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell. Considering the geopolitical situation, the Group has limited opportunities to manage and develop its subsidiary
in Russia. Taking into consideration the Group’s plan to sell the subsidiary it was measured at fair value less costs to sell
based on the management’s best estimate of fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group, taking into account non-binding
indications of the possible sales price. Losses from impairment of goodwill and remeasurement of disposal group are
recognized in consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Note 36 - The Group’s ability to continue as a going concern
The Group’s management evaluates the actual and potential impact of geopolitical situation on the economic activities and
financial results of the Group. Group management has prepared the projected financial results and cash flows for 2023 and
has already begun to take steps to ensure the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern (including the intended
restructuring within Storent Holdings group). For more information, see Note 36.
(f) Fair value
The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. The objective of a fair value measurement is to estimate the price at which an orderly
transaction to sell the asset or to transfer the liability would take place between market participants at the measurement date under
current market conditions. For fair value calculation the Group determines the following:
- the particular asset or liability that is the subject of the measurement (consistently with its unit of account);
- for a non-financial asset, the valuation premise that is appropriate for the measurement (consistently with its highest and
best use);

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(f) Fair value (cont.)
- the principal (or most advantageous) market for the asset or liability;
- market approach is the valuation technique(s) the Group uses for the measurement – it uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable (similar) assets, liabilities,
or a group of assets and liabilities (e.g., a business).
(g) Business combinations
According to IFRS 3 Business ir an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed
for the purpose of providing goods or services to customers, generating investment income (such as dividends or interest) or
generating other income from ordinary activities. A business combination is defined as a transaction or other event in which
an acquirer (an investor entity) obtains control of one or more businesses. Identifying a business combination transaction
requires the determination of whether what is acquired constitutes a ‘business’ as defined in IFRS 3, and control has been
obtained. On business combinations:
- identifiable assets and liabilities acquired are measured at fair value;
- goodwill recognized as an asset and gain on bargain purchase as an income;
- transactions costs are expensed when incurred;
- deferred tax on initial temporary differences recognized as assets and liabilities;
- contingent consideration recognized at fair value at acquisition date, subsequent changes to the profit or loss if not
initially classified as equity.
(h) Segment information
Reportable segments are operating segments or aggregations of operating segments that meet specified criteria. An operating
segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses
(including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the Group), is a component of the Group whose
operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group’s chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be
allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available. Segment information
is presented for Group’s operating segments, which are determined by geographical split. Operating segments are managed
separately and they are separately reported in internal management reporting to the Council and the Board.
(i) Revenue recognition
The Group recognises revenues according to IFRS 15 “Revenues from contracts with customers”, using the 5-step model.
The model consists of:
1. Determination of contractual relations;
2. Determination of contract performance obligation;
3. Determination of transaction price;
4. Attribution of transaction price to the performance obligation;
5. Recognition of income, when the Group has fulfilled the performance obligation.
The following criteria are used for determination of contractual relations:
- The contractual parties have approved a contract and are committed to fulfil their liabilities;
- The Group may identify the rights of each party in relation to deliverable goods or services;
- The Group may identify settlement procedures for the goods or services;
- The contract has commercial nature;
There is high possibility, that the Group will charge remuneration due to it in exchange for goods or services that
will be transferred to the customer.
Determination of contract performance obligation.
The performance obligation exists, if there are distinct goods or services transferred to the customer or a series of distinct goods or
services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Group has considerate following
factors as to whether a promise to transfer goods or services to the customer is not separately identifiable:
- Group does provide a significant service of integrating the goods or services with other goods or services promised
in the contract;
- the goods or services are highly interrelated or highly interdependent.
Determination of transaction price
The transaction price is the amount to which Group expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of goods and services.
When making this determination, Group will consider past customary business practices. Where a contract contains elements
of variable consideration, the entity will estimate the amount of variable consideration to which it will be entitled under the
contract. Variable consideration can arise, for example, as a result of discounts, rebates, performance bonuses.

Registration number: 40203174397
2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(i) Revenue recognition (cont.)
Attribution of the transaction price to the performance obligation
Generally, the contract with the customer includes a specified transaction price for each performance obligation. If applicable,
the Group uses the adjusted market assessment method for determination of the market price. A discount is applied
proportionally for each performance obligation, based on the relative goods or services sales prices. Any overall discount
compared to the aggregate of standalone selling prices is allocated between performance obligations on a relative standalone
selling price basis. In certain circumstances, it may be appropriate to allocate such a discount to some but not all of the
performance obligations.
Customers can earn loyalty points that are redeemable against any future transactions of the Group’s products. The points
accumulate and expire after one year. The Group recognizes this as a separate performance obligation and allocates a part
of the transactions price applying the same principles as described above. The amount allocated to the loyalty points is initially
deferred and recognised as revenue when loyalty points are redeemed or on expiry.
Recognition of revenue, when the Group has fulfilled the performance obligation
Transport and related services revenue
Revenue is recognised over time as the services are provided, that is based on criteria that the customer simultaneously
receives and consumes all of the benefits provided by the Group and, generally, invoiced on a monthly basis.
Fulfillment of performance obligations for transport and related services is measured based on the output method –
performance to date, and there is no significant judgement applied to determine the fulfilment of the performance obligations.
Revenue from sale of inventories and property, plant and equipment used for renting
Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the corresponding asset is delivered to and accepted by the customer, thus,
transferring the control and fulfilling the performance obligation, and, generally, invoiced at that point in time.
Contract assets and liabilities
Contracts with customers are presented in the Group’s statement of financial position as a receivable. Invoices according the
contract are generated at least once per month. Invoices are usually payable within 15-45 days. A contract liability is presented
in the statement of financial position where a customer has paid an amount of consideration prior to the Group performing by
transferring the related good or service to the customer.
(j) Employee benefits
Short-term employee benefits are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability is recognised for the amount expected
to be paid if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided
by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
(k) Government grants
The Group recognises a government grant when it has reasonable assurance that it will comply with the relevant conditions
and the grant will be received.
A government grant that becomes receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or for the purpose of
giving immediate financial support to the entity with no future related costs is recognised in profit or loss of the period in which
it becomes receivable.
Government grants related to assets, including non-monetary grants at fair value, are presented in the statement of financial
position either by setting up the grant as deferred income or by deducting the grant in arriving at the carrying amount of the
asset.
(l) Income tax
The corporate income tax consists of the income tax calculated for the reporting year and deferred income tax. It is recognised
in comprehensive income.
Current tax
Corporate income tax for the reporting year (Lithuania)
The corporate income tax for the reporting year has been calculated, by applying the corporate income tax rate of 15% to the
taxable income for the tax year.
Corporate income tax for the reporting year (Estonia and Latvia)
The net profit of Group entities located in Latvia and Estonia is not subject to corporate income tax; however, income tax is
levied on all dividends paid by these companies. Corporate income tax in Latvia and Estonia is calculated at the profit
distribution (20/80 from net amount to be paid to shareholders). Corporate income tax will be recognized as tax payable at
the period when shareholders decide to distribute profit.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(l) Income tax (cont.)
Corporate income tax for the reporting year (Finland)
The corporate income tax for the reporting year has been calculated, by applying the corporate income tax rate of 20% to the
taxable income for the tax year.
Corporate income tax for the reporting year (Sweden)
The corporate income tax for the reporting year has been calculated, by applying the corporate income tax rate of 20.6% to
the taxable income for the tax year.
Corporate income tax for the reporting year (Russia)
The corporate income tax for the reporting year has been calculated, by applying the corporate income tax rate of 20% to the
taxable income for the tax year.
Deferred tax
Deferred income tax arising due to temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying
amounts in these consolidated financial statements has been calculated, using the liability method for all countries the Group
operates. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply when the
related temporary differences reverse. The key temporary differences result from different depreciation tax rates applied under
tax and accounting legislation and tax losses carried forward.
A deferred tax asset shall be recognized for the carry forward of unused tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses and unused tax credits can be
utilized. When considering whether a deferred tax asset can be recognized the management uses their judgment in estimating
whether there will be sufficient taxable profits in the future and about their timing and the overall future tax planning strategy.
Deferred income tax and profit distribution in (Latvia and Estonia)
Specific accounting for deferred tax due to tax regimes have been applied in the respect of Latvia and Estonia. According to
legislation requirements in these countries corporate income tax is applicable to distributed profits. In case of reinvestment of
profit, corporate income tax shall not be applied.
In accordance with International Accounting Standard No 12 “Income Taxes“ requirements, in cases where income tax is
payable at a higher or lower rate, depending on whether the profit is distributed, the current and deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured at the tax rate applicable to undistributed profits. In Latvia and Estonia, the applicable rate for
undistributed profits is 0%.
As a parent controls the dividend policy of its subsidiaries, it is able to control the timing of the reversal of temporary differences
associated with these investments including the temporary differences arising from undistributed profits. Therefore, in the
consolidated financial statements the Group could recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities in the respect of its investments
in subsidiaries using tax rate applicable to distributed profits. In cases the parent has determined that subsidiary’s profits will
not be distributed in the foreseeable future the parent does not recognize a deferred tax assets and liabilities.
(m) Finance income and finance costs
The Group’s finance income and finance costs include:
- Interest income;
- Interest expense;
- the foreign currency gain or loss on financial assets and financial liabilities;
Interest income or expense is recognised using the effective interest method. The ‘effective interest rate’ is the rate that exactly
discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to:
- the gross carrying amount of the financial asset; or
- the amortised cost of the financial liability.
In calculating interest income and expense, the effective interest rate is applied to the gross carrying amount of the asset
(when the asset is not credit-impaired) or to the amortised cost of the liability. However, for financial assets that have become
credit-impaired subsequent to initial recognition, interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the
amortised cost of the financial asset. If the asset is no longer credit-impaired, then the calculation of interest income reverts
to the gross basis.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(n) Intangible assets
Goodwill
The consideration transferred in a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the
acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred by the Group, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of
the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs
are recognised in comprehensive income as incurred. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration
transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer's previously held
equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed. Goodwill is disclosed in intangible assets section.
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date of acquisition of the business less
accumulated impairment losses, if any. Impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. For the purpose of impairment testing, recoverable amount - value in use -
is determined by discounting the future cash flows generated from the continuing use of assets and was based on the following
key assumptions: Cash flows were projected based on financial budgets approved by the management covering a five-year
period. Each of the Group’s subsidiaries was determined to be a separate cash-generating unit (“CGU”). Cash flows were
calculated separately for each CGU, key assumptions for calculations are the same for all CGU: five-year business plan for
each CGU, discount factor, which is based on WACC calculation, and Group total IBD was divided between each CGU
according to fleet proportion. The five-year business plan is based on the following assumptions: Group’s amortisation and
depreciation costs, IT costs, management fee, insurance costs and interest expenses are allocated to individual budget of
each CGU according to fleet proportion allocated. Fleet proportion was calculated as a percent from total Group fleet according
to fleet location to the date, when impairment test was performed. By using the same fleet proportion all Group’s liabilities for
equipment purchase are allocated in impairment calculation. Loss from goodwill impairment is recognized in consolidated
statement of comprehensive income. Please, also refer to Note 12.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets primarily comprise capitalized costs of internally developed software. Other intangible assets are
measured at historical cost amortized on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the assets. If some events or a change in
conditions indicates that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable, the value of the respective intangible
asset is reviewed for impairment. Impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible assets exceeds its
recoverable amount.
Development costs of intangible assets
Development expenditure is capitalised only if the expenditure can be measured reliably, the product or process is technically,
and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable, and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to
complete development and to use or sell the asset. Otherwise, such expenditure is treated as research costs and recognised
in comprehensive income as incurred. In the reporting period, the Group did not incur any research costs.
A project initiated by the Group met all the above criteria. The item “Intangible assets in process” included only those costs
that the Group can reliably estimate. The development of intangible assets was started in 2020 and was completed at the end
of 2022. This intangible asset is recognized as a corporate asset because it cannot generate independent cash flows but will
be used in the operations of all Group companies. At the end of 2021 and 2022, this item was not assessed separately and
was included in the impairment test of total assets, allocating this item by CGU equal to the current IT cost allocation in the
Storent group. In December 2022, the roll-out process of the new IT system has started and the development costs were
transferred to Computer software, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
impairment losses. The implementation of the new IT system is planned to be completed by the end of 2023.
Development costs are presented as Intangible assets in progress and are stated at historical cost. This includes the cost of
development and other directly attributable expenses. Intangible assets in progress are not amortized as long as the
respective assets are not completed and put into operation. Expenditure on research activities, if any, is recognised in
comprehensive income as incurred.
Amortisation
Amortisation is calculated based on the cost of intangible assets less their estimated residual values, which, generally, are
insignificant, using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is recognised in comprehensive income.
Goodwill is not amortised. Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and
adjusted, if appropriate, to reflect the Group’s management current view on their remaining useful lives in the light of changes
in technology. The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets for current and comparative periods are as follows:
Trademarks and domains 5 years
Software licenses 3 years

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(o) Property, plant and equipment
Property plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. The acquisition costs
include all expenditures attributable to binging the asset to working condition. In addition to direct purchasing expenses, it
also includes other expenses related to the acquisition, such as transportations and assembling costs. Subsequent
expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to
the Group.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for
current and comparative periods are as follows:
Machinery and equipment 4 - 12 years
Other 2 - 5 years
Construction in progress represents property, plant and equipment under construction and is stated at historical cost. This
includes the cost of construction and other directly attributable expenses. Construction in progress is not depreciated as long
as the respective assets are not completed and put into operation.
Leasehold improvements are amortised over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement and the term of the lease
agreement.
Depreciation is calculated based on the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values
using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and is recognised in comprehensive income. Each part of an
item of property, plant and equipment with a cost that is significant in relation to the total costs of the item is depreciated
separately. Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in comprehensive income.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted, if appropriate, to
reflect the Group’s management current view on their remaining useful lives in the light of changes in technology, the
remaining prospective economic utilization of the assets and their physical condition. Group has fixed assets that are fully
amortized and still are in use.
(p) Impairment of tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill
At the end of each reporting period, the Group assesses the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine
whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the
recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not
possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash
generating unit to which the asset belongs. Each Group’s subsidiary was determined as separate CGU.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated
future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been
adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying
amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised
immediately in consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash generating unit) is increased to
the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in
prior years.
(q) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognized initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
After initial measurement, borrowings are carried at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method. The amortized
value is calculated including any acquisition related discount or premiums and payments that are an integral part of the
effective interest rate and transaction costs. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any loan or borrowing issue
costs, and any discount or premium related to loans or borrowings.
(r) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value.
Costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition is measured for as follows:
- Consumables and finished goods are measured at cost of purchase applying “first in first out” (FIFO) method;
Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all estimated costs of completion
and costs necessary to make the sale, as well as assesses the physical condition of inventories during the annual stock count. Net
realizable value is stated as cost less allowances.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(s) Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale
Non-current assets and disposal groups that will be recovered through sale rather than through continuing use are classified
as non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale. An asset or a disposal group held for sale is measured
at the lower of its previous carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
The conditions that must be met before a non-current asset or a disposal group can be classified as held for sale or discounted
operations are as follows:
 The non-current asset or disposal group must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to
terms that are usual and customary for sale of such assets or disposal groups; and
 Its sale must be highly probable, i.e.
- management must be commited to a plan to sell the non-current assets or disposal group;
- an active program to locate a buyer and complete the plan must be initiated;
- the non-current assets or disposal group must be actively marked for sale ar a reasonable price in relation to its
current fair value;
- the sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from date of classification;
- actions required to complete the plan should indicate that it is unlikely that the plan be changed significantly or be
withdrawn.
At the end of the reporting year 2021, the Group management has commited plan and list of non-current assets, that will be
recovered through sale; sales chanel to realize this sale has found. All assets were ready for immediate sale. Non-current
assets that are classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
At the end of the reporting year 2022, the Group management has commited plan to sell a subsidiary company. This subsidiary
is presented as a disposal group held for sale. Expected fair value less costs to sell is lower than the net carrying amount of
the disposal group’s assets and liabilities. Remeasurement loss on a reclassification of disposal group as held for sale is
allocated first to impairment loss on goodwill, and then to the remaining assets. Please see Note 16.
(t) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in bank and in hand, deposits held at call with banks with maturities of three months
or less.
(u) Contingent liabilities and assets
The Group does not recognize any contingent liabilities in these financial statements. Contingent liabilities are disclosed,
unless the probability that an outflow of resources will be required is remote. No contingent assets are recognized by the
Group, they are disclosed if it is probable, that the economic benefits related to the transaction will flow to the Group.
(v) Provisions
A provision is recognized if the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, and it is
probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required from the Group to settle the obligation,
and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the Group expects that the expenditure required to
settle the provision will be reimbursed by another party partly or fully, e.g., under the terms of an insurance contract, the
reimbursement is recognized as a separate asset when and only when it is virtually clear that the reimbursement will be
received. In the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the expense relating to a provision may be presented net
of the amount recognized for a reimbursement. Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provisions are
calculated by discounting the future expected cash outflows, using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market
assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. If discounting is used, increase in provisions is
gradually recognized as borrowing costs.

(w) Financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets
Recognition, classification and subsequent measurement
A financial asset is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to a contract that is a
financial instrument. On initial recognition, the Group classifies and measures a financial asset at amortised cost if it meets
both of the following conditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:
 it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows; and
 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI)
on the principal amount outstanding
The Group classifies its financial assets as financial assets at amortised cost in line with its business model to hold the financial
assets and collect the contractual cash flows, which consist only of payments of principal and interest on the outstanding
principal amount. The assets in the statement of financial position that belong to this category are Trade receivables and
Other receicables. These assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The
amortised cost is reduced by impairment losses. Foreign exchange gains and losses and impairment are recognised in
consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in consolidated statement
of comprehensive income.
A financial asset is derecognized if:
 the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire;
 the Group retains the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset, but assumes a contractual obligation
to pay cash flows without material delay to a third party based on and earlier arrangement without any profit arising
 the Group transfers the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the and either (a) it transfers substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership of the financial asset to a third party, or (b) it neither transfers no retains substantially all the risks
and rewards of ownership of these assets but has transferred control over the item of financial asset.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group applies the simplified approach under IFRS 9. The Group always recognises lifetime ECL (expected credit losses)
for trade receivables and contract assets. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible
default events over the expected life of a financial instrument. The expected credit losses on these financial assets are
estimated using a provision matrix based on the Group’s historical credit loss experience in each geographical location of
operations separately over a two-year period, adjusted for factors that are specific to the debtors (please see also Note 17).
General economic conditions and an assessment of both the current as well as the forecast direction of conditions at the
reporting date, including time value of money are not incorporated into the calculation.
The Group considers a financial asset to be in default when the borrower is in significant financial difficulty and is unlikely to
pay its credit obligations to the Group in full, without recourse by the Group to actions such as realising security (if any is
held); or the financial asset is more than 90 days past due. Such financial assets in default are considered to be credit-
impaired.
Loss allowances for financial assets measured at amortised cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets.
Factoring
The Group has entered into certain factoring contracts, by which it sells the receivables to a factor and receives a part of the
amount due immediately and the remainder when the customer settles its liability towards the factor. When the Group sells
the receivables to the factor, it derecognizes the corresponding financial assets and recognizes a new receivable due from
the factor. The Group’s factoring contracts are considered as factoring without rights of regress. The proceeds received from
the factor are presented in the Statement of cash flows as cash flows from operating activities.

(w) Financial assets and financial liabilities (cont.)
Financial liabilities
Recognition, classification and subsequent measurement
A financial liability is recognised in the statement of financial position when the Group becomes party to a contract that is a
financial instrument.
All of the Group’s financial liabilities are classified as measured at amortised cost. Financial liabilities are subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses are
recognised in consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Any gain or loss on derecognition is also recognised in
consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
A financial liability is derecognized, if the obligation specified in the contract is discharged or cancelled or expired. On
derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount extinguished and the consideration paid
(including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed) is recognised in comprehensive income.
Where there has been an exchange between an existing borrower and lender of debt instruments with substantially different
terms, or there has been a substantial modification of the terms of an existing financial liability, this transaction is accounted
for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between
the respective carrying amounts is recognized in consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Please refer to relevant Notes.
Offsetting
Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of financial position when,
and only when, the Group currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the amounts and it intends either to settle them
on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
(x) Leases
The Group as lessor
Leases, for which the Group is a lessor, are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases
are classified as operating leases. The Group, as a lessor, has not classified any lease as a financial lease.
When the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for the head lease and the sublease as two separate contracts. The
sublease is classified as a finance or operating lease by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct
costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and
recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Group as a lessor, generally, concludes short-term operating
lease contracts with no non-cancellable period.
The Group as lessee
The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease, at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right-of-
use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-
term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets (such as tablets and
personal computers, small items of office furniture and telephones). For these leases, the Group recognises the lease
payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more
representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the lessee uses its incremental
borrowing rate.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:
 Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;
 Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement
date;
 The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;
 The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and
 Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (cont.)
(x) Leases (cont.)
The lease liability is presented as a separate line in the statement of financial position. Group lease payments are based on
concluded financial lease agreements with fixed lease payment schedule.
The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using
the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.
The Group remeasures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever:
 The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the
assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised
lease payments using a revised discount rate.
 The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed
residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using an
unchanged discount rate (unless the lease payments change is due to a change in a floating interest rate, in which case
a revised discount rate is used).
 A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease
liability is remeasured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a
revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.
The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or
before the commencement day, less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently
measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the period of the lease term.

Deferred income tax:
The Group management has determined that eligable subsidiary’s profits in Latvia and Estonia will not be distributed in the foreseeable
future, and, thus, the Group has not recognized related deferred tax liabilities. The unrecognized deferred tax liabilities as at 31 December
2022 amount to EUR 2 531 512 (31.12.2021: EUR 1 644 260).
The unused tax losses, for which deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent of taxable temporary differences, as at 31 December
2022 consist of EUR 8 803 899 (31.12.2021: EUR 8 270 226) that expire from 2028 to 2032 and EUR 6 179 570 (31.12.2021: EUR 5 945
637 that, under certain conditions, do not expire. There are no other material deductible temporary differences and unused tax credits for
which no deferred tax asset is recognised.
The Group’s management has prepared a Business plan for the next five-years. Based on the five-year business plan for Finland, Sweden
and Lithuania the management doesn’t see that the next five-years’ taxable profit will be enough to cover the previous tax losses. As a
result, the Group’s management decided to recognize deferred tax assets only in the amount equal to the deferred tax liabilities that are
expected to reverse in future reporting periods.

All intangible assets are used by the Group.
Fully amortized intangible assets
On 31 December 2022, intangible assets of the Group included assets with acquisition value of EUR 3 925 441 (31.12.2021.:
EUR 2 717 463), which were completely written down into amortization costs and are still actively used in economic activity. Most of these
intangible assets consist of software, which continue to be used, and for which annual maintenance and improvement fees are paid.
Development of intangible assets
In 2020, the Group started to develop a new ERP system that meets the development trends of modern IT technologies in the business
environment, especially as a result of Covid-19 impact, and will provide effective accounting of rental processes, control procedures of
the Group companies and operational information for the Group's management to make decisions. The item "Intangible assets in progress"
included only those costs that the Group could reliably estimate and that met IFRS capitalization criteria. In 2022 and 2021, there are only
external intangible development costs capitalized. In December 2022, the development process of the new ERP system was completed
and the implementation process and its use in the Group companies’ everyday operations began; as a result the development costs were
transferred to the item “Other intangible investments”. The roll-out of the new ERP system is planned to be completed by the end of 2023.

growth rate
To determine the key assumptions of EBITDA margin and EBITDA growth rate, the Group management has considered both the Group’s
past experience as well the future trends and forecasts of the construction market in the specific country where the CGU is located.
The recoverable value of goodwill and other non-current non-financial assets significantly depends relating to the newly established
Storent Holdings group’s net turnover growth, EBITDA margin (as a result of internal cost optimization and internal transfer pricing
adjustments) and timing and magnitude of EBITDA growth, discount rate used, as well as the ability of Group’s management to implement
these assumptions and the development of the Baltic and Nordic construction equipment rental market in general. Any unfavorable
changes in these assumptions that may be caused by volatility of the market, in which the Group operate, may have a negative influence
of the carrying amount goodwill and other non-current non-financial assets recognized on the Group’s consolidated balance sheet as of
31 December 2022. Please refer further to Notes 35 and 36.

Sensitivity analysis
The Group has conducted an analysis of the sensitivity of the impairment test to changes in the key assumptions used to determine the
recoverable amount for each of the CGUs to which goodwill is allocated. Analysis of the sensitivity is based on same assumptions as
impairment test and as described above. Management estimated that all Baltic countries will reach a similar EBITDA margin level by
increasing sales and significantly improving efficiency as outlined above, especially in Estonia.
The key assumptions that can affect the recoverable value and, thus, the carrying amount of the cash-generating units are the fulfilment
of the EBITDA budget and the weighted average cost of capital. The table below shows the impact of the change in these two
assumptions on the value headroom/(impairment) of the cash-generating unit.

Based on the calculations performed by management, a decrease in EBITDA or increase in discount rate would lead to the fact that the
carrying amount of Estonian CGU, including the allocated corporate assets, may not reach the expected recoverable amount as of
December 31, 2022. The management of the group, in close cooperation with the management of the Estonian CGU, carefully considers
and implements the sales strategy in Estonia in order to prevent non-compliance with the planned EBITDA level.

16. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale
Non-current assets classified as held for sale
By the end of year 2021, Group management decided to sell the old equipment, which is no longer competitive in the market. Selected
equipment for sales has been reclassified and moved from property, plant and equipment and rights of use assets to non-current assets
held for sale. Before reclasification of equipment its balance value was compared to an estimated fair value less costs to sell. Estimated
fair value less costs to sell was determined at market prices for same equipment with a similar technical condition. It was found that the
balance value of equipment was lower than the estimated fair value less costs to sell. Therefore, revaluation of fixed assets is not necessary
by the end of year 2021. There are no cumulative income or expenses included in Other comprehensive income relating to assets held
for sale.

Disposal group classified as held for sale
Considering the geopolitical situation, the Group has limited opportunities to manage and develop its subsidiary in Russia. At the moment,
there is no possibility to make payments to or from the subsidiary company, so the management of the Group has decided to sell the
subsidiary company. By the end of year 2022, the Group management committed to a plan to sell the subsidiary Storent OOO, Russia,
Kaliningrad. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are presented as a disposal group held for sale. Efforts to sell the disposal
group have started and a sale is expected by the end of 2023.
Impairement losses of EUR 329 585 on goodwill of the remeasurement losses of EUR 384 204 for write-downs of the disposal group to
the lower of it carrying amount and its fair value less costs to sell have been included in “Impairement loss”. The remeasurement of the
net carrying amount of property, plant and equipment, inventory, trade receivables, cash and current liabilities within the disposal group
has been performed based on the management’s best estimate of fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group, taking into account
non-binding indications of the possible sales price.

Interest is not charged on late payment of receivables. Generally, trade receivables are due within 15 - 45 days.
Allowance for doubtful debts is expressed as lifetime expected credit loss and is calculated on a collective basis using simplified approach
under IFRS 9.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. The Group’s management
has established a credit policy under which each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard
payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, if they are available, financial
statements, credit agency information and industry information. Sale limits are established for each customer and reviewed yearly. Any
sales exceeding those limits require approval from the entity management or Group management. Monitoring customer credit risk is
going on daily basis. Monitoring includes actual information from credit agency and review past due trade payables by each entity debt
controllers. Please also see Note 33.
Main assumption of simplified approach under IFRS 9:
The appropriate grouping Group uses debt grouping by countries for measurement of loss allowances on a collective
basis
Period Group uses a 2-year period to estimate historical loss rate

Macro-economic factors The Group did not find any material connection between actual credit loss rate and macro-
economic factors. In the management’s view, this is due to the construction sector often used
to stimulate economic activity during an economic downturn.
Forward-looking information In line with the conclusion on macro-economic factors above, the Group presumes that
historical loss rates will prevail also in the future, and no adjustments at historical loss rates
are done.
Trade receivables are not secured or collaterized.
The gross carrying amount of a trade receivables is written off when the Group has no reasonable expectations of recovering a trade
receivable in its entirety or a portion thereof. The Group individually makes an assessment with respect to the timing and amount of
write-off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery. The Group expects no significant recovery from the amounts
written off. However, trade receivables that are written off could still be subject to enforcement activities in order to comply with the
Group’s procedures for recovery of amounts due.

Sale-and-leaseback transactions
In 2016 to 2018, the Group entered into sale-and-leaseback transactions that resulted in sales proceeds exceeding the carrying amount
of these assets, and the difference has been accounted as Deferred income. In line with IFRS 16 transition requirements, the Group
continues to amortize the deferred gain on a strength-line method over the lease term for each of such assets.
In 2019, the Group entered into two sale-and-leaseback agreements, for which the Group assessed that the transactions did not result
in a sale as the Group continued to control the underlying assets. The Group presents the received financing as lease liabilities and
presents the excess of financing received over the carrying amount of the underlying assets as deferred liabilities.

32. Financial instruments
Current and non-current loans and borrowings, trade receivables, cash and finance lease are the Group’s key financial instruments.
The financial instruments are held to finance the operating activities of the Group. The Group handles many other financial instruments,
e.g., trade and other receivables, trade and other payables that arise. None of the Group’s financial assets or financial liabilities are
measured at fair value. Fair value is determined at initial recognition and, for disclosure purposes, at each reporting date.

33. Financial risk management
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are
categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows.
— Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
— Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e., as
prices) or indirectly (i.e., derived from prices).
— Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value
measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the
entire measurement.
Fair value of Trade receivables and Other receivables with no stated interest rate and cash and cash equivalents is deemed to
approximate their face value on initial recognition and carrying value on any subsequent date as the effect of discounting is immaterial
and therefore not disclosed in these financial statements.
Fair value of financial liabilities with outstanding maturities shorter than six months, other than issued bonds, is deemed to approximate
their face value on initial recognition and carrying value on any subsequent date as the effect of discounting is immaterial and therefore
not disclosed in these financial statements.
Fair value of financial liabilities with outstanding maturities longer than six months, other than issued bonds, is estimated based on the
present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted using the effective interest rate of the corresponding agreement
which, in the management’s view, represents the market rate of interest at the measurement date for companies similar to the Group.
The Group’s subsidiary Storent Investments AS issued bonds are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The market for these
bonds is not assessed as an active market. The significant non-observable key input to determing the fair value of the issued bonds is
that no adjustment to the observable quotes is required.
All of the Group’s financial assets and financial liabilities are determined to be Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels in 2022 and in 2021.
Please refer to Note 35 for the description of fair value considerations for the business combination effected in 2022. All fair value
assessments are Level 3.
The key risks associated with the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk. The
management develops risk management policy in respect of each of the risks.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the Group incurred a financial loss if counterparty will fail to fulfil their obligations to the Group. The Group
has credit risk exposure related to trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents. The Group controls its credit risk by closely monitoring
the customer payment history and setting separate terms and conditions to individual customers. In addition, the Group closely
monitors receivables balances to minimize the possibility of bad debts.
In terms of receivables as at 31 December 2022 and 2021 the Group did not have a significant credit risk concentration in respect of
a single transaction partner or a group of partners of similar transactions.
The Group manages credit risk by independently assessing counterparty credit history and defining acceptable credit limit. The Group
regularly monitors the overdue trade receivables. Trade receivables have a carrying amount which is reduced by loss allowances for
bad and doubtful trade receivables (see Note 17).
The maximum credit risk exposure at 31 December 2022 was EUR 8 372 761 (31.12.2021: EUR 7 081 809).

Sensitivity analysis
A reasonably possible change in the weighted average loss rates at 31 December would have affected the measurement of loss allowance
of trade receivables and affected profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant,
and that loss rate is floored at 0% and capped at 100% of the gross carrying amount.

33. Financial risk management (cont.)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to timely and in full to ensure fulfilling its own commitments. Liquidity risk arises
when terms of payments of financial assets and liabilities are not correlating. The Group's liquidity risk management is to maintain
adequate cash and cash equivalent amount and provide sufficient financing in order to be able to fulfil its obligations in time. The Group
manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, planning payments of trade payables as well as developing
and analysing future cash flows. The budgeting system used by the Group is helpful in the management and control of liquidity risk
management.
The Group's management considers that the Group will have sufficient cash resources and its liquidity will not be compromised. As at
31 December 2022, the Group's liquidity ratio was 0,37. As at 31 December 2021, the Group's liquidity ratio was 0,35. Please refer to
Note 36 for going concern considerations.
At 31 December 2022 and 2021 the maturity of the financial liabilities of the Group, based on undiscounted payments provided for in the
agreements can be disclosed as follows:

33. Financial risk management (cont)
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk of financial losses incurred by the Group due to adverse fluctuations in interest rates. The Group is exposed
to interest rate risk mainly related to its current and non-current lease liabilities, while the interest rates on the Group’s other liabilities
are fixed and, thus, not subject to interest rate risk. This exposes the Group to the risk that interest expenses will increase in a situation
when interest rates go up. The average interest rate on the Group’s liabilities is disclosed in Notes 24, 25, 26 and 31 c. The Group
doesn’t use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
As the variable part of the interest rate applied to lease liabilities is floored at 0%, the sensitivity of the Group’s comprehensive income
and equity (as a result of the lease liabilities (see Note 25) with a variable interest rate element of 3M EURIBOR) to a reasonably possible
interest rate change of +/- 0.5%, other variables remaining constant, is considered immaterial to the Group’s financial performance.
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk of financial losses incurred by the Group due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
This risk arises when financial assets denominated in a foreign currency do not match financial liabilities in that currency, which results
in open currency positions.
The Group does not have any material balances of financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the Euro. All of
the Group’s borrowings and lease liabilities are denominated in Euro, and, thus, not subject to foreign currency risk.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk mainly arising from transactions denominated in the Russian rubles (RUB) due to entity
operating in Russia Kaliningrad region and Swedish krona (SEK) due to entity operating in Sweden.
The summary quantitative data about the Group’s exposure to currency risk as reported to the management of the Group is as follows:
31 December 2022 31 December 2021

the balance sheet date.

Due to geopolitical situation last time RUB exchange rate has been published by ECB on 1 March 2022. In order to provide users with
more accurate information, Group management decided to use the market rate for RUB transactions: for period 1 January 2022 till 1
March 2022 ECB published rate, starting 2 March 2022 and till the end of period rate, which is available on major financial market platforms
which are providing real-time data (www.investing.com).
Sensitivity analysis
A reasonably possible strengthening (weakening) of the euro, Swedish krona, Russian ruble against all other currencies at 31 December
would have affected the measurement of financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency and affected equity and profit or loss by
the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant and ignores any
impact of forecast sales and purchases.

34. Capital management
The purpose of the management of Group capital is to provide a high credit rating and balanced structure of capital to ensure successful
activity of the Group and to maximize Group’s share value. The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.
The Group is controlling structure of the capital and adjusts that structure according to economic conditions. For control and adjustment
of structure of the capital, the Group can change conditions of payment of dividends to shareholders, to return them part of shares or

35. Business combinations
35. (a) Subsidiaries acquired
On 28 December 2022, Storent Holdings acquired all shares of Storent Investments AS and SEL Investments SIA. Both companies’
business activity is rental of industrial equipment. Storent Investments AS and its subsidiaries in addition to a modern rental fleet and a
large rental depo network have a wide customer base with a very well-developed trademark, experienced team and digital know-how. SEL
Investments SIA and its two subsidiaries own around 50% of the construction equipment fleet that Storent group operates. The merger of
both groups will allow to increase expertise and improve financial ratios to continue the development of the Storent Holdings Group with
a significantly higher speed and profitability.
Both acquisitions have been determined to have an integrated set of activities and assets, including relevant inputs and processes that
are applied to those inputs, to be considered businesses as per IFRS 3 requirements.
The Group accounts for these business combinations as reverse acquisition – Storent Holdings (the legal acquirer) is identified as the
accounting acquiree and Storent Investments (the legal acquiree) is identified as the accounting acquirer due to its relative size and nature
of operations. As a result, from the point of view of the combined entity (the Group), the acquisition of SEL Investments and Storent
Holdings are accounted for using the acquisition method.

The Group incurred acquisition-related costs EUR 105 148 on legal fees. These costs have been included in ‘Other administrative
expenses’ in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
*These consolidated financial statements are the continuation of the consolidated financial statements of the legal acquiree Storent
Investments AS (identified as the accounting acquirer), excluding equity, and are reflecting the following:
- assets and liabilities of the legal acquiree (identified as the accounting acquirer) are recognized and measured at their pre-
acquisition carrying amounts;
- assets and liabilities of the the legal acquirer (identified as the accounting acquiree) are recognized and measured at their fair
value on acquisition date;
- the consolidated statement of comprehensive income of the the legal acquiree (identified as the accounting acquirer) for the full
reporting period and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income of accounting acquirees since the date of their
acquisition and up to the end of the reporting period.
The management has assessed that the nominal value of the consideration transferred (equity instruments issud) reflects their fair value.

The valuation techniques used for measuring the fair value of net assets and liabilities acquired were as follows:
- For Property, plant and equipment market comparison technique and cost technique were applied. The valuation model
considers market prices for same or similar items when they are available, and depreciated replacement cost when appropriate.
Depreciated replacement cost reflects adjustments for physical deterioration as well as functional and economic obsolescence.
To determine market prices were collected the sales prices of equipment sold on auctions and to splitrent vendors. Based on
the price summary for the sold equipment, the accounting values of the existing fixed assets were verified, and it was found that
there are no material differences between the market price and the accounting (carrying) value.
- Fair value of Cash and cash equivalents, Trade and other receivables, Trade and other payables and Other borrowings, all
carried at amortized cost, due to their short-term maturity approximated their carrying amount on the date of acquisition.
- Trade and other receivables mainly include trade receivables from contracts with customers, and are mainly related to a
significant exposure to a specific counterparty that, before the acquisition, was used as an intermediary for transactions between
Storent Investments AS group and SEL Investments AS group. Due to their short-term nature, the Group expects that materially
all contractual cash flows from Trade and other receivables will be collected.

Settlement of pre-existing relationship
SEL Investments SIA and its subsidiaries had issued loans to Storent Investments AS and its subsidiaries in the end of December 2022
before the date of the acquisition in the total amount of EUR 650 000 as at the date of acquisition. This pre-existing relationship was
effectively terminated on the date of acquisition. As the fair value of the relationship approximated its carrying amount on the date of
acquisition there was no gain or loss recognized on the settlement of the pre-existing relationship.
Gain on bargain purchase from SEL Investments SIA acquisition is recognized in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income
in the reporting period within the line item ‘Gain on bargain purchase’. Identifiable net assets acquired on the acquisition of SEL
Investments mainly consist of property, plant and equipment. While the fair value of these assets on an individual basis, based on the
management’s assessment, approximate their carrying amount, these assets are generally of a specialized nature and exposed to the
same set of risks, i.e. heavy equipment to be used in construction sites. This presents difficulties in selling such assets in bulk and over
a short time frame, requiring a discount to their fair value, which has resulted in the Group recognizing a gain on bargain purchase. No
intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition have been identified.
The difference between consideration transferred and fair value of identifiable net assets acquired from Storent Holdings SIA, as per
reverse acquisition, has been recognized directly in equity to Retained earnings / (Accumulated losses) under recapitalization line item.

d) Impact of acquisitions on the results of the Group
As these consolidated financial statements have been prepared following a reverse acquisition as a continuation of the amounts from
the consolidated financial statements of Storent Investments AS, the consolidated results of the Group for 2022 include the consolidated
statement of comprehensive income of the the legal acquiree (identified as the accounting acquirer) Storent Investments AS for the full
reporting period and the consolidated statements of comprehensive income of accounting acquirees Storent Holdings SIA and SEL
Investments SIA and its subsidiaries SELECTIA SIA and SELECTIA PLUS SIA since the date of their acquisition and up to the end of
the reporting period.
Presented below are the adjusted results for the Group as if it existed from the 1 January 2022, which combine Storent Holdings SIA,
Storent Investments AS (consolidated) and SEL Investments SIA and its subsidiaries SELECTIA SIA and SELECTIA PLUS SIA
statements of comprehensive income for 2022. The Group management considers these numbers to provide a reference point for
comparison of the results of the Group in future periods.
Storent Investments AS and its subsidiaries and SEL Investments and its subsidiaries were parties to a contract under which SEL
Investments and its subsidiaries provided Storent Investments AS and its subsidiaries with equipment rental services under a split-rent
arrangement, while Storent Investments AS and its subsidiaries provided repair and maintenance services to SEL Investments and its
subsidiaries. In these transactions also a third-party intermediary Preferrent SIA, which is not a part of the Group, was involved, and the
services received from this intermediary were effectively terminated on the date of acquisition. The amount of the markup applied by the
intermediary for these transactions in 2022 was EUR 52 649, which has been adjusted for in the adjusted result below.
SEL Investments and its subsidiaries had issued a loan to Storent Investments AS and its subsidiaries in the end of December 2022
before the date of the acquisition, and the resulting interest income / expenses in 2022 is assessed as immaterial to the adjusted result
of the Group.

36. Going concern of the Group
The Group’s financial performance in the reporting year was a profit of EUR 4 774 540 (2021: loss of EUR 3 402 850), and the profit in
2022 is a result of recognized one-off gain on bargain purchase in the amount of EUR 7 270 495 as a result of the business combination
effected. At the end of the year, the Group’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by EUR 9 893 768 (31.12.2021: current liabilities
exceeded current assets by EUR 16 329 132), as a result of significant borrowings approaching maturity. Both of these conditions may
cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Group’s management has evaluated the current and potential impact of the geopolitical situation in the Baltic and Nordic region as a
result of the Russian Federation commencing war activity in Ukraine. Management has prepared forecasted financial results and cash
flows for 2023 demonstrating the Groups’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to continue as going concern and already started to take steps to
address the expected liquidity and profitability shortages, such as:
 On December 28, 2022, SIA "Storent Holdings" became the sole shareholder Storent Invetsments AS. Consequently, Storent
Investments and its subsidiary companies become part of the newly established holding, which, in addition to the Storent group,
also includes SEL Investments SIA group, which holds investments in construction equipment rental companies SELECTIA SIA
and SELECTIA PLUS SIA. Storent Investments AS and its subsidiaries in addition to a modern rental fleet and a large rental depo
network have a wide customer base with a very well-developed trademark, experienced team and digital know-how. SEL
Investments SIA and its two subsidiaries own around 50% of the construction equipment fleet that Storent group operates. The
merger of both groups will allow to increase expertise and improve financial ratios to continue development of the Storent Holdings
group with a significantly higher speed and profitability. The restructuring of the newly established group commenced at the end of
2022. By increasing net revenues by on average 10% in 2023, the management plans to reach up to EUR 5 million net profit in
2023.
 In 2023, the Group plans to increase rental income in all its countries of operation by on average 10% it total, as noted above.
Further revenue and profitability growth is expected from investing in new equipment in 2023 up to 7 million euros and from selling
older equipment units as previously mentioned. Overall inflation allows to increase rental prices and gives positive impact on sales
volumes. Management estimates that the construction industry will continue with the steady moderate growth in the Baltics. Nordic
countries construction market values are estimated to slightly decrease in 2023. Construction market volume historical data and
forecast doesn’t always reflect the construction rental market potential. It depends on the construction project types and stages at
the exact year. The Group’s entities growth possibilities are higher in the markets, where Storent has smaller share of the market.
It’s expected that the lack of construction workforce and higher personal costs will increase prices and demand of rental
construction equipment, as construction companies will look for ways how to replace manual work with increased use of tools and
equipment. It is expected that Rail Baltica project will give a significant positive impact on the construction industry in the Baltics.
 The Group continues to work on operational efficiency by developing online sales and paper-less rental process. Equipment
delivery organization via logistic online platform Cargopoint increase efficiency of transportation services.
 In April 2023, Storent Holdings announced new bond issue of up to EUR 15 million, which will for the first time be open to both
retail and institutional investors. The Group will use the proceeds for new investments, further mergers and acquisitions and to
refinance its existing liabilities.
 Based on above, the Group management plans further development of subsidiaries in five countries. The main focus in 2023 will
be to continue online sales development, digital transformation and efficiency increase. The Group will continue to transform its IT
strategy to comply with the scalability needs.
 The Group management has evaluated the current geopolitical situation and its impact on the Group companies, especially the
subsidiary entity in Russia, Kaliningrad. At the end of 2022, the Group management has decided to sell the subsidiary in Russia
(Kaliningrad) and currently it is in process of legal formalities. Minimum estimated net sales consideration is already reflected on
the Group’s balance sheet when assessing the recoverable value of the asset held for sale (investment in subsidiary) as at 31
December 2022. At the moment of issue of these financial statements Storent OOO continues to operate without significant
changes independently from the group. The Group monitors and follows sanction restrictions and, so far, these don’t affect the
subsidiaries’ activities.
• After the year end, the Group has started the legal reorganization process, which was approved in the end of 2022, in order to
complete the merger of SEL Investments SIA with Storent Investments AS and Selectia SIA, Selectia Plus SIA with Storent SIA by
the end of 2023, which will save administrative costs, excluding mutual transactions and the costs associated with their accounting
and simplifying internal processes in the subsidiary entities. Since January 2023, all equipment owned by Selectia SIA and Selectia
Plus SIA is leased to subsidiary companies of Storent Investments AS without the intermediary of the PreferRent platform, which
creates savings for the group entities.
• Compared to the first quarter of 2022, the Group’s unaudited consolidated revenues in the first quarter of 2023 have increased by
8% and the amount of consolidated losses has decreased by 20%. Historically due to the seasonality of the construction industry
the first quarter of the year was always loss making.
Taking into account the information currently available, the most recent key performance indicators of the Group and the actions taken
by management, Group entities expect to continue operations as a going concern. As such, these consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on the basis that the Group will continue as a going concern, and do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary if the going concern assumption would not be applicable.

Non-adjusting events
In April 2023, Storent Holdings SIA announced a new bond issue of up to EUR 15 million which will for the first time be open to both

To the shareholders of Storent Holdings SIA

accompanying consolidated Annual Report, which comprise:
— the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December
2022,
— the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 December 2022,

— the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended, and
— the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of significant
accounting policies and other explanatory notes.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view
of the consolidated financial position of Storent Holdings SIA and its subsidiaries as at
31 December 2022, and of its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash
flows for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
Basis for Opinion
In accordance with the ’Law on Audit Services’ of the Republic of Latvia we conducted our
audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing adopted in the Republic of Latvia
(ISAs). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’
Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards
Board for Accountants’ International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including
International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code) and independence requirements
included in the ’Law on Audit Services’ of the Republic of Latvia that are relevant to our audit
of the consolidated financial statements in the Republic of Latvia. We have also fulfilled our
other professional ethics responsibilities and objectivity requirements in accordance with the
IESBA Code and the ’Law on Audit Services’ of the Republic of Latvia.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.
Reporting on Other Information
The Group’s management is responsible for the other information. The other information
comprises:
— General information, as set out on page 3 of the accompanying consolidated Annual
Report,
KPMG Baltics SIA, a Latvian limited liability company and a
member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent
member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a
private English company limited by guarantee.
— the Management Report, as set out on pages 4 to 6 of the accompanying consolidated
Annual Report,
— the Statement on Management Responsibility, as set out on page 7 of the accompanying
consolidated Annual Report.
Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information
included in the consolidated Annual Report, and we do not express any form of assurance
conclusion thereon, except as described in the Other Reporting Responsibilities in
Accordance with the Legislation of the Republic of Latvia Related to Other Information section
of our report.
In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to
read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained
in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed and in light of the knowledge and understanding of
the Group and its environment obtained in the course of our audit, we conclude that there is
a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have
nothing to report in this regard.
Other Reporting Responsibilities in Accordance with the Legislation of the Republic of Latvia
Related to Other Information
In addition, in accordance with the ‘Law on Audit Services‘ of the Republic of Latvia with
respect to the Management Report, our responsibility is to consider whether the Management
Report is prepared in accordance with the requirements of the ‘Law on the Annual Reports
and Consolidated Annual Reports’ of the Republic of Latvia.
Based solely on the work required to be undertaken in the course of our audit, in our opinion,
in all material respects:
— the information given in the Management Report for the financial year for which the
consolidated financial statements are prepared is consistent with the consolidated
financial statements; and
— the Management Report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the
‘Law on the Annual Reports and Consolidated Annual Reports’ of the Republic of Latvia.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated
Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that
give a true and fair view in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and
for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation
of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related
to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do
so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial
reporting process.
Auditors’ Responsibility for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial
statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error,
and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs
will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud
or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably
be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain
professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
— Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial
statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures
responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting
from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,
forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
— Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
— Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of
accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
— Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of
accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty
exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability
to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are
required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our
opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to
continue as a going concern.
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial
statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements
represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a fair
presentation.
— Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the
entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated
financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance
of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the
planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant
deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
